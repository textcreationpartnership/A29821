            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For I doe ingenuouſly confeſſe, and humbly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that this worke rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the ſkilfull Penſill of a rare <hi>Apelles</hi> to draw to the life, or the learned quill of an eloquent <hi>Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> to demonſtrate to the full, than my unworthy illiterate Pen or dul invention to deſcribe. Yet having by Gods enablement upon my weak endevours framed this rare ſtructure in my minde, I could not reſt ſatisfied, till I had writ what I had ſo rudely formed. And ſo I have beene bold to compare it to King <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple: for as in that rare Fabrick, there were three courts, the Outward, Middle, and <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum;</hi> ſo likewiſe in this worke I doe obſerve three kindes or <hi>Species</hi> of Meditations The firſt as the outward Court, are Meditations of the foure ſeaſons of the Yeare, the foure Elements and their effects: The ſecond as the middle Temple, are Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58256:13"/> of the ſeven Planets, on thoſe dayes that commemorate the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious workes of our Saviour Chriſt: And the third, as <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> are Meditations of the ſtarry Chriſtalline and firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heaven, on divers feſtivall dayes in the yeare. Now as in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> Temple there was a porch or gate, where being entred, you might diſcerne the ſpaciouſneſſe of the outward court, and the decent behaviour of the people attending upon the royall High Prieſt therein, the ſolemne offices and ſervices performed by the Prieſts and Levites in the middle Temple, and the beauteous luſtre of <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum:</hi> So likewiſe this worke or building hath a porch or door, which is this briefe Survey of this <hi>Annuall World;</hi> for I have ſet it here in this place as a Preface or Introduction to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Meditations, wherein you may take a ſhort view of this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58256:14"/> ſquare court in briefe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of the foure Seaſons of the yeare, and foure Elements, which are as the foure corners thereof. The firſt, is the Spring and Aire; the ſecond Summer and Fire; the third Autumne &amp; Earth; and the laſt is Winter and Water. As the four ſides of the court you ſhall finde foure pleaſant Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The firſt is of a Flower o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening with the Sunne (<hi>Chriſt</hi>) which is a Meditation on the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> The ſecond is a Tree ſet with the Sun (<hi>Chriſt</hi>) which is a meditation on Palme-ſunday; on the third ſide you ſhall finde a Rainbow, as on the South, which is a meditation on Great Britains Feaſt, the fifth of <hi>November;</hi> and on the laſt ſide, you ſhall behold the <hi>Aequator,</hi> or Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall line, as on the North, which is a meditation on the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntiation of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you have taken a view of this
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58256:14"/> outward court, you may behold the glory of the true High Prieſt Chriſt Jeſus, in the inner Temple.

And as there were three things in the Arke, ſo Aſtrologers note three things in the ſtarry fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament: Firſt, the North-pole, which I name the Eaſt-pole, on the Epiphany. Then the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole, which I fix on Innocents day: and laſtly, the Zodiake with which I encompaſſe all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Saints dayes in the yeare. Then you may behold the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Cherubins that looke toward the Mercy-ſeat, on the Feaſt of Saint <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-Angell, in the Metaphor of the Chriſtalline

And laſt of all you may have a glimpſe of the glorious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory or Oracle, from whence God revealed himſelfe to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael, on Trinity Sunday, in the metaphor of <hi>Primum mobile.</hi> Thus having ſeene the out ſide of this goodly Fabrick, Now let me demonſtrate the reaſons which induced my fancy to cal this Book <hi>A deſcription of an Annuall World.</hi> And they are but two: Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as the <hi>World</hi> is round, ſo is the <hi>Yeare</hi> likewiſe: Secondly, as the <hi>World</hi> conſiſts of the four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the firmament of the heavens; ſo doth the <hi>Yeare</hi> alſo conſiſt of elements and celeſtiall bodies. To ſhew that the world is round, I ſhall only write what the <hi>Geographers,</hi> who are the deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Earth, ſay, that the Earth and Waters make one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Globe; and what the <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians</hi> or <hi>Aſtrologians</hi> (who bend their ſtudy in the nature of

And all theſe doe ſhew, that the compaſſe of the world is round as a bowle or circle, which is ſignified by the ſeverall terms of Globes, Sphears and Orbes. And that the Yeare likewiſe is round, the very name thereof doth import; for the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> name <hi>Annus</hi> ſignifies a Ring or Circle. But beſides the Name, the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58256:16"/> Nature of the yeare doth ſhew its Annuall or circular Motion, for times and ſeaſons in the yeare ſwiftly whirle round about; and ſtill where it laſt ended, there it begins againe. As in a cart wheele the ſeverall ſpokes follow one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in their round or winding motion: that as that ſpoke which was but now upon th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Spring followes the Winter, the Summer ſucceeds the Spring; &amp; Autumne followes the Summer, and ſo comes to be Winter againe. Secondly, as the world conſiſts of foure Elements, ſeven Planets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſtarry Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Chriſtallin and firſt moving heaven, ſo I have ſhewed, and by the aſſiſtance of the Almighty, I doe intend in this following trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe to make manifeſt, that the ſeaſons of the yeare may have an

Now I will conclude this Proeme with a prayer to God: that it would pleaſe him ſo to aſſiſt, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, and guide me in this worke, and all other godly reſolutions and enterpriſes that I ſhall take in hand, that as the yeare keeps and continues in its annuall or circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar courſe, ſo I likewiſe may be never weary of well doing, nor give over my heavenly race of piety, but hold out to the end; that ſtill as I end, ſo I may begin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in new obedience, and new wayes of godlineſſe: that ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lived the life of grace here on this globe of earth and water;

               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Ver,</hi> or the Spring, like a young lively youth, of a ſanguine complexion, roſie cheeks, ſmooth face, of light and nimble motion, caſteth a cheerefull and lovely look upon the face of the earth, and with a greene, fragrant, and lightſome mantle, cloathes her groſſe body, in variety of whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome hearbs, ſweet flowers, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious fruit, and nouriſhing grain, for the uſe of Man and all crea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures. Now it is that Fowles of the aire couple, beaſts of the earth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and fiſh of the water mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply in abundance, and leave the deepe to live in more ſhallow pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The countrey life is moſt pleaſant, and the aire moſt pure and wholeſome: to which ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment this ſeaſon is reſembled: For as the nature of the aire is hot
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58256:18"/> and moiſt, ſo is the Spring or ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine complexion of a cheerefull and comfortable condition. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I conclude this ſeaſon with a prayer to God, that (as in the ſpring all vegetative and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive creatures begin to grow and increaſe upon the face of the earth and waters; ſo) it would pleaſe him to ſow in my heart ſuch ſaving ſeed, that now I may begin to grow and increaſe in ſpirituall knowledge, and bring forth the pleaſant fruit of a holy life and righteous converſation, to the glory and praiſe of God, the good of my neighbour, and ſalvation of my owne ſoule.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Aeſtas</hi> or Summer, like a man of full growth, ſtrong and luſty, in the prime of his ſtrength, with a fierce and fiery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect parcheth &amp; withereth graſſe and graine: for now hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> is at the higheſt, floods at the loweſt, the ſeas moſt patient, and the winds
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58256:19"/> moſt calme, the earth ſuted in her richeſt imbroidery diſtributeth her bounty to the uſe of living creatures; flowers are now in their bravery, fruits in their prime, and all creatures in their luſtre. The Sun is now in his chiefeſt ſtrength, and is as hot as fire, which is the Metaphor to which I compare this quarter of the yeare: for as the element of fire is hot and dry, ſo is the quality of Summer, or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of choler. The leſſon that I gather from hence is, that as the Summer ripens all grains &amp; fruits, ſo doe I deſire of God to ſend downe the Son of righteouſneſſe into my ſoule, to quicken, inflame, and ripen the graces of his Spirit ſowne therein by the ſeed of his ſacred Word, that I may ſeeme beautifull and lovely as a burning and ſhining lampe in the midſt of a froward generation, that others of greater gifts ſeeing ſome little ſparke of goodneſſe in me, may be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58256:19"/> incited thereby far to exceed and excell me, in vertuous qualities and commendable works.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Autumnus</hi> or Harveſt, like an ancient man with a white head and gray beard, of a ripe age, full of good workes in his youth and ſtrength, performed with an auſtere, ſolid, melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſage countenance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> looking upon the face of the earth with a favourable aſpect, renders to the toyling Huſband-man the fruits of his former labours: for now graſſe is mowne, corne reaped, fruits ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, leaves fall, flowers fade, and the earth loſeth her former beauty; floods increaſe, ſprings decreaſe, and all creatures loſe their ſtrength and vigour, and the moſt part of ſenſible creatures ſeeke ſhelter againſt the ſtormy enſuing Winter: and therefore well compared to the earth, being cold and dry, of a ſolid temper, groſſe body, and lumpiſh diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58256:20"/> (though the naturall quality of this quarter is cold and moiſt as water.) Now the uſe that I learn from hence is, to pray to God to ſend his illuminating Spirit into my heart, that I may ſeriouſly conſider, and wiſely ponder all my former actions, &amp; from thence gather and receive the comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fruit of the good God hath enabled me to performe, and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, heartily, and unfeinedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of thoſe things I have done that I ſhould not, againſt God, my neighbour, or my ſelfe: that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I may prepare and labour to make my ſelfe ready with ſuch ſtrong and approved furniture as may be able to defend me againſt the bluſtrous and ſtormy aſſaults of the fleſh, the world, and the devill, at the winter of pale fac't death.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Hyems</hi> or Winter, like an angry old man worne out with cares, perplexed with griefe, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58256:20"/> impatient in ſuffering, with a waſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh, fretfull, and phlegmatick countenance, looketh upon the face of the earth: for now the bluſtring winds break forth, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the billowes of the Ocean to ſwell, threatning to ſwallow the ſea-toſt Mariner: floods are up; and the cold aire taketh away the ſtrength and vigour from all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The pores of the earth are ſhut by the extreame coldneſſe of the aire; beaſts and cattell ſeeke for ſhelters; Monſters, Serpents, and ravenous creatures for dens, fowles betake themſelves to the warmeſt regions, and fiſhes to the deepeſt waters: ſo that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the cheerfull Spring, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Summer did bring forth and nouriſh, this quarter doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy and vaniſh. In nature it is cold and moiſt as the waters (yet the true naturall quality of this quarter is cold and dry as earth) and well likened thereto, becauſe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58256:21"/> of their roaring and turbulent motions; for the Winter is for the moſt part tempeſtuous and ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, in mighty winds, ſlabby rain, thrilling haiel and ſnow, nipping froſt, and chilling cold. Now the uſe that I draw from hence, is, the conſideration of old age; that I having by the enablement of <hi>Gods</hi> Spirit finiſhed the delightfull and pleaſant flower of my age in the growth of piety, the flouriſhing Summer of my dayes in vertuous and commendable actions, and the fruitfull contemplation and meditation of the good I have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, may by <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> ſeeke and provide for my poore ſoule a ſafe harbour in the Merits of my bleſſed Saviour, againſt the approaching winter of old age, when the ſun of naturall heat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth, the froſt of chilling griefs perplex mee, and the bluſtrous ſtormes of ſlanderous tongues backbite me. And ſo laying and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58256:21"/> bequeathing my body quietly and comfortably in the bed of the grave, my ſoule may with joy and alacrity aſcend to receive a new growth in eternall glory, with God and the reſt of his choſen veſſels.</p>

And as ſoone as I arrived on the land, I beheld a glorious Tree, under the branches where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I thought to repoſe my ſelfe and reſt; but being cold and wet, I was enforced to go into the freſh aire, to receive the comfortable heat of the Sun to drie and warme me. And walking in a garden I
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58256:22"/> beheld the faireſt flower that ever was ſeene; and being raviſhed with the ſight thereof, but much more with the ſmell, I had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to pluck it up by the roots, &amp; as I was taking hold on it, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Gardiner came to me, and told me that I muſt take heed that I doe not too raſhly touch it, leſt I might deerely pay for it, for that it was ſet there for ſhow and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, but not to be toucht by me nor any; which threatning I fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring preſently awaked, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the morall thereof to be to this effect; that I having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to make a deſcription of the whole Univerſe in the Holydayes of the yeare, and having accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For though ſhe came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the noble ſtock of many famous Kings of Iſrael and Juda, being the daughter of <hi>Eliakim,</hi> of the houſe of <hi>David;</hi> yet by reaſon of the mutation of worldly feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, ſhee was poſſeſſed with no great wealth. And ſo according to her eſtate a man of mean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> a Carpenter of the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58256:27"/> ſame lineage of the Tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Iacob</hi> (who was the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Heli</hi>) whoſe wife the ſaid <hi>Iacob,</hi> according to the Leviticall Law, after his ſaid brothers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe, maried; ſo raiſing up ſeed unto his brother, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Heli</hi> (according to Saint <hi>Lukes</hi> Goſpell) made choice of her for his ſpouſe. And their poverty is more evident, in that they were not of ability (when they were called to the generall taxation) to get roome in an Inne, but faine to take up their lodging in a poore, cold, and comfortleſſe manger. For her laborious travell, firſt ſhe went to Jeruſalem, being three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and foure miles from Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, to which place, of neceſſity ſhe was to paſſe over diverſe high and ſteepe hils, as Mount Gilboa, whereon King <hi>Saul</hi> kild himſelfe, Mount Gerizim and Hebal, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the bleſſings and curſes were denounced, and Mount E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58256:28"/> upon which <hi>Ehud</hi> kild <hi>Eglon</hi> King of the Moabites. Then when her Childe was two yeares old, with whom ſhe and <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> to accompliſh the Word of the Lord, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 11. 1. and for feare of <hi>Herods</hi> cruelty, were conſtrained to flye into Aegypt, and continued all the dayes of <hi>Herods</hi> cruell reigne at <hi>Hermopolis,</hi> one of the chiefe Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Aegypt, three hundred and foure miles from Jeruſalem, to which place of neceſſity they were to paſſe thorow a barren and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull wilderneſſe, full of rocks and ſands, deſtitute of waters, and ſubject to many dangers, inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a rude and barbarous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, called <hi>Saracens,</hi> who take their beginning from <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and as he, ſo they are very cunning in ſhooting and hunting, and live upon robbery and ſpoile. In ſo much as Merchants at this day are conſtrained to go in great compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, leſt they ſhould be endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58256:28"/> by them and ſavage beaſts which abound in thoſe places. And by reaſon of the windes and ſands, they are enforced to guide their journey by the Compaſſe, as men do that ſaile by Sea. Yet thorow this wilderneſſe did <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> paſſe, with the Childe <hi>Jeſus,</hi> out of Judea into Aegypt; where they were in danger of theeves, ſubject to be ſmothered by the ſands, conſtrained to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell over high rocks and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and to reſt in feare of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Beares, and other beaſts of prey, that greatly abound there: beſides, other diſcommodities were incident unto them, as want of meat, drink, and other neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, there being little water to be found there. After, when they came from thence to Nazareth, ſhe with <hi>Ioſeph</hi> went every yeare to the Paſſeover at Jeruſalem, for the ſpace of fourteene yeares to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, about which time <hi>Ioſeph</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:58256:29"/> dyed, when Chriſt was ſixteene yeares old, and her ſelfe thirty. And as I finde related, during her pilgrimage in this world, which was nine and fifty yeares, ſhe tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled 3506. miles, beſides petty journeyes not worth relation. And laſt of all for her perplexity and vexation of ſpirit; behold and ſee if the propheſie of <hi>Simeon</hi> was not fully accompliſhed in her, that a ſword ſhould paſſe thorow her ſoule. Beſides the miſeries which ſhe ſuſtained in her travell into Aegypt, as is above ſpecified, when ſhe had carefully brought up her Son for the ſpace of twelve years, by remiſſeneſſe and neglect, ſhe with <hi>Ioſeph</hi> thought him loſt, and were faine to ſeek him three daies ſorrowing.

And ſo from the Paſſion of Chriſt to her death, which was twelve yeares, ſhe lived with the beloved Diſciple S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Evangeliſt in Ieruſalem, and was buried in the Garden called <hi>Gethſemane.</hi>

               <p>Thus having deſcribed the beautifull luſtre of this pleaſant Flower, and felt the odoriferous ſavour of this heavenly Plant; look on I pray you, one ſlip more ſprung from this fragrant Flower, which I had almoſt forgot, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58256:30"/> that is her religious care and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Leviticall Law, or decent order in the Church of God that then was, <hi>viz.</hi> her cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſing her Son the eighth day, her preſenting him to the Lord, and purifying her ſelfe as on this day, according as God by <hi>Moſes</hi> preſcribed. For as Chriſt had no originall ſinne, ſo he needed not to be circumciſed, as ſhal be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Newyeares day; ſo likewiſe the Virgin needed not this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward purifying, which figured our cleanſing from originall ſin, wherein the child conceived and born, polluteth his Mother; which was not ſo in this, for both the conception and birth of Chriſt was ſupernaturall, for ſhe is ſaid to <hi>have ſwadled the Childe,</hi> beyond the ordinary ſtrength of women, who need a Midwife; neither was ſhe troubled with the uſuall flux of other women in their <hi>Puerpery, being free from the thing hereby ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58256:30"/> viz.</hi> a ſinfull child; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the common opinion is, that Chriſt came forth without any paine, helpe or pollution, the wombe of the Virgin remaining ſhut; even as the Sun-beams pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the ſolid glaſſe without hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, for ſhe received no humane ſeed, but was with childe by the Holy Ghoſt. Now why this cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of ſanctifying was uſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, by preſenting him in the Temple, and making an oblation for him, is thus anſwered by <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us;</hi> That Chriſt was ever holy from eternity as he was God, and from the very moment of his concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as he was Man; wherefore he was not preſented before the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor ſanctified for himſelfe, but for us, according to the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Law. Now ſuch things as in the Scriptures are ſaid to be ſanctified, are either ſanctified in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, by Inſtitution, or Sacrament. Indeed, in their Nature, or by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58256:31"/> In Nature, when by the grace of God things are made ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which were not ſo before; by declaration, when things before holy, are manifeſted to be ſo. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by Inſtitution things are ſanctified by vertue of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and promiſe of bleſſing; as the Sabbath is ſanctified. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by Sacrament things are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, either abſolutely, or rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, that is, both by ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by the truth of the thing ſignified. And thus Chriſt was ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, though he be the truth of the Sacrament. Firſt, becauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Man he would obey the Law, under which he was made: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that he might ſanctifie the Law in his own Perſon. By Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, he was ſanctified for us, we receiving the bleſſing through him, as our firſt borne, and Prieſt, abrogating the Leviticall Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. And by manifeſtation he was ſanctified, when by obſerving
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58256:31"/> this Law he was declared holy. Wherefore this act of the Virgin being voluntary, as I have ſhewed, it was to ſhew her zeale and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the decent orders of the Church of God. To this might be added her conſtant courſe in keeping the Paſſeover every year, which was a work of great labour &amp; travell. But now theſe ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall ſhadowes at the preſence of the moſt glorious bright Sunne Chriſt Jeſus, vaniſhing away, the Chriſtian Church in all ages ſince hath in place, or in ſtead of the Jewes Purification, ordeined and inſtituted the purification of the heart, by a true, lively, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Faith, and the purification of the life, by unfeined and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty repentance, in that commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and decent order of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing women after their great deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from their pain and perill of child-birth, &amp; enjoyneth them to bring not (as then) a lambe, or
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58256:32"/> two young pigeons, but (the ſum of all Legall ſacrifices) hearty prayer and thankſgiving, which conſiſts not onely in the lippes, but in the life and converſation. Therefore every religious &amp; wiſe woman will not be ſo wedded to their own opinion or ſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, to think that it is any diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to her perſon (be ſhe never ſo great) or a point of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to give publick praiſe to God in his Church, but will be willing (as <hi>Mary</hi> here was) to conforme themſelves to the godly diſcipline of the publick worſhip of God in his Church (if ability of body hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not) as well as zealous in their own private devotions; for they well know, that one duty of Piety ought not to juſtle out ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that it is very requiſite that our private and voluntary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequies ſhould give place to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſolemnities. The ſacrifice ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for this ſolemnity makes
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58256:32"/> this apparant: for the Turtle and the Dove are bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now they (ſaith <hi>Calvin</hi>) are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that think the Law of Purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to be but a politick law, for God hereby would ſet before the Iewes eyes the corruption of their nature, and the remedy of divine Grace, &amp; did not appoint this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the purifying of the wife as
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58256:33"/> polluted towards her husband, but this one law doth abundantly prove originall ſin; it being here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by intimated, that the child com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth into the world ſo impure, as that the very mother is polluted hereby. The offering was for the redemption of the firſt-borne, <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit.</hi> 12. 6.

Whereas the child was before preſented with gold, it is not to bee thought that they brought him any great quantity, but ſome little offering, more for honour than for enriching. It is to be conſidered, wherefore a pair of Turtles or two Pigeons were now offered. The Turtle is moſt in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quacitie among Birds, and the Dove in mildneſſe: And ſuch is Jeſus become unto us, being moſt milde: And Chriſt as the Turtle by the voice of his Goſpell, and the ſincere preaching thereof, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lureth

               <head>A TREE. Or <hi>A Meditation on Palme Sunday.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN the former Meditation you have viewed a fragrant Flower. Now as oppoſite to that, you may be pleaſed to behold a flouriſhing Tree, upon which the <hi>Sunne of Righteouſneſſe</hi> did ſet. And as a Tree I conſider it, firſt in its root or ſtation, ſecondly, in its fruit or operation. Firſt, for its root or foundation, to know the reaſons why this day is called Palme-ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, my ſmall learning cannot ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly decide nor determine, for the Goſpell appointed or ſet apart for the publique ſervice of God on this day makes no mention of <hi>Palme,</hi> nor any thing that hath Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference thereunto: for whereas
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:58256:36"/> 
                  <hi>Palme,</hi> is a note of Victory and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph; this dayes Goſpell contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thereto makes a ſad relation of our Saviours Death and Paſſion. And the Goſpel that ſeemes more to correſpond with the name of this day (and as ſome affirme) was uſually read in Churches in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times on this day, is not unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtated upon the firſt of the foure Sundayes before the day of our Saviours Nativity, called Advent Sunday, becauſe thoſe Sundayes are appointed for us as preparato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to entertaine the benefits of Chriſts incarnation into our ſouls, as the Jewes did his corporall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence into Jeruſalem, with great joy and triumph. So the chiefe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (as I conceive) why this victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Palmes Goſpell</hi> is thus tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted from this day to Advent Sunday, and yet that this day ſhould ſtill retaine the name, is (as before is ſpecified) to be as <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was, a fore-runner, or har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binger,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:58256:37"/> 
                  <hi>to prepare the way for the comming of the great King Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> into this <hi>Annuall World:</hi> or thus, the root of this dayes deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination ſprings from theſe two grounds or cauſes. Firſt, becauſe that as this day falls alwayes in the Spring ſeaſon; and <hi>Palme</hi> (as ſome note) is one of the firſt Trees that buds: ſo men that are ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Trees in the Spring of their age, aſſoone as they come to knowledge, ſhould prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the entertainment of Chriſt into their hearts, by ſtriving to grow in piety and ſpirituall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. 2. Becauſe (as ſome ſay) <hi>Palm</hi> delighteth &amp; flouriſheth moſt by the rivers ſide; ſo Chriſt and all Chriſtians flouriſh and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come moſt victorious by the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome waters of perſecution and affliction. To prove the veritie hereof: All writers almoſt affirme this ſame very day Chriſt went to Jeruſalem in that triumphant
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:58256:37"/> manner, as in the Goſpel is related, five dayes before his Paſſion; to ſhew that in ſuffering he became victorious over ſin, death, and all the Temptation of the Devill, and in dying hee overcame death, which gave the Church (ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) occaſion to goe in proceſſion with <hi>Palmes</hi> in their hands on this day, from whence it was called <hi>Palme-ſunday.</hi> Thus having briefly demonſtrated the radical founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this dayes denomination, I ſhould now ſhew you the fructifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation thereof. For though the <hi>Palme</hi> (which grows in our Iland) beares no fruit at all, but onely a ſpongie or ſoft bloſſome growes upon it, thereby (as I conceive) to ſhew the vanity of all worldly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and triumphs, (of which <hi>Palme</hi> is an Embleme) yet this <hi>Annuall Palme</hi> (as the Date-tree) will afford as many fruitfull medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, as there are words in the Goſpell, as is learnedly accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58256:38"/> by that pious Gentleman Mr. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his divine Meditations, out of whoſe pleaſant Garden I will only gather this ſweet and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull fruit of <hi>Humility,</hi> which growes upon the top of this Tree, and yet it is to be ſeene in every branch thereof: for <hi>Humility</hi> the <hi>higher</hi> it is, the <hi>lower</hi> it will ſtoope: therefore as it is the concluſion of his, ſo it ſhall be the period of my meditation for this day, on which our bleſſed Saviour by his <hi>Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> triumphed over the Pride of the world, and aſcended to true glory, by ſuffering death upon the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious croſſe.

               <p>In the yeare of our Lord 1603, in the beginning of the ſaid Kings reigne, this horrible Treaſon was firſt of all contrived and inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Robert Catesby</hi> Eſquire, as he confeſſed at his death, and took all upon himſelfe, excuſing the reſt, that they were allured and ſeduced by him.

               <p>Secondly, as the Sunne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the <hi>Aequator</hi> makes the day and night of equall diſtance, ſo alſo Chriſt the Son of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe as this day comming by divine inſpiration or ſemination
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:58256:54"/> into the wombe of the bleſſed Virgin; The cloudy night of the ceremoniall Law, and the bright day of the glorious Goſpell were now upon even tearmes. The law like the Moon having enlightned the world for almoſt two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares, as ſome ſay, gives place to the Sun of the Goſpell to finiſh his race, <hi>to enlighten them that ſat in the darkneſſe</hi> of ignorance and ſhadow of ceremonial figures and types.</p>
               <p>But as yet this Sun did not break forth, it was hid under a cloud, as on this day it newly entred into this bleſſed <hi>Aequator.</hi> For now it was that the bleſſed Virgin by a celeſtiall creature, <hi>An Angell of great power, Gabriel</hi> by name, ſent from the bleſſed Trinity, was ſhewed the wonderfull concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her Lord and Maker, that ſhe ſhould bring him forth, that by his word brought forth all things; that ſhe ſhould be a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

               </p>
               <p>Here is a wonder above all won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, for from eternity it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard, that Eternity ſhould enter into the Kalendar of Time, that Immenſity ſhould be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, Infinity bounded, Ubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity incloſed, and the Deity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnated.

               </p>
               <p>This contract was long before all time made in heaven, and ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of by Prophets ever ſince the world began. <hi>The promiſed ſeed of the woman,</hi> in <hi>Adams</hi> time, typified in the <hi>heavenly dew in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>edeons fleece</hi> in theſe particulars. Firſt, as that fleece, ſo the Virgin received this
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:58256:55"/> heavenly dew, when all the world was barren, beſides her. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the filling that fleece, was a ſigne of the Jewes delivery; and the conception of this Virgin a ſigne, and a beginning of ours. Thirdly, this fleece received the dew without hurt to the wooll: and this Virgin conceived this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall dew, without the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her fleſh. Fourthly, <hi>Gedeon</hi> wrung out this dew, and filled a veſſell with it: And <hi>Mary</hi> brings forth her Son (that fills this great Veſſell, the World, and all that is in it.) But laſtly, in this ſhe exceeds the fleece of <hi>Gedeon;</hi> for of the fleece of her body, Chriſt made himſelfe a Garment (even his own fleſh) which he weares to this day, and will doe for ever. This was foretold by <hi>Eſay</hi> expreſſely. <hi>Behold a Virgin ſhall conceive, and bring forth a Sonne:</hi> And in a figurative ſpeech by <hi>Jeremy, Behold,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Lord will worke a new thing upon
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:58256:56"/> earth, a woman ſhall compaſſe a man.</hi> A ſtrange ſaying, yet true, for it was no new thing for one of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to bee made of another: ſo was <hi>Eve</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi> long ſince; for a man to be made without man and woman is older, for ſo was <hi>Adam;</hi> And for one to bee made of man and woman, is almoſt as old, and much more common; but for one to be made of a woman without man, that's a rare and new thing indeed. And ſo was Chriſt only.</p>
               <p>And to ſhew it is a new worke, we begin our accounts and recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings as from this day, and date the year accordingly. This month the year begins to conceive and bring forth fruite in the delightfull Spring; and ſome affirme that God began the worlds creation as on this day, to ſhew that all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come new.</p>
               <p>For the confirmation of the truth of this glorious conception, conſider the predictions before
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:58256:56"/> rehearſed, and many other, as of the time, <hi>Gen. 49. 10. The Scepter ſhall not depart from Iuda, nor a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver from betweene his feet untill Shiloh come;</hi> Of the place, <hi>Eſay 9. 1. The Land of Zabulon and Nepthalim, neare the way of the ſea beyond Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan and Galilee of the Gentiles, a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that ſate in darkneſſe, and in the ſhadow of death, ſaw a great light;</hi> And <hi>of his line and ſtocke, Eſay 11. 1. There ſhall come a Rod out of the ſtem of Ieſſe, and a branch ſhall grow out of his roots.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The very manner thereof is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obſervable, and the Meſſage or Annunciation made unto the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin by the Angell, as it is related by the Evangeliſt; and Fathers make it apparent and conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: for albeit it depend princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally upon the relation and credit of the Virgin her ſelfe, who was only privie thereunto, and upon the teſtimony of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> to whom it was revealed by the ſame Angell
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:58256:57"/> afterward; yet wee may conſider the circumſtances of the thing it ſelfe; as firſt the ſimplicity of both the reporters, then how that it is not likely that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> being Juſt (as is deſcribed) would have concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a thing ſo much againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and againſt the Law, if he had not been ſome way aſſured of the truth thereof. Thirdly, the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent age of the Virgin (who was not paſt fourteene yeares old at that time, as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and ſome other ancient Fathers doe prove by manifeſt arguments.) All theſe things doe make it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable that ſhee would invent ſuch a thing of her ſelfe. And finally, the ſtrange propheſie w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ſhee uttered in her Canticle of <hi>Magnificat,</hi> and which we ſee now fulfilled (albeit at that time very unlikely) to wit, that <hi>all Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhould call her bleſſed,</hi> doe make it plainly appeare that the matter muſt needs be true.</p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:58256:57"/>
               <p>But why ſtand I thus upon that which is an Article of our Beleefe, and requires more the mouth of Faith to receive and apprehend it, then the hand or tongue of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane reaſon to demonſtrate or deſcribe it: for he is anathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed that doth not beleeve this Goſpell; therefore I will now leave to write any further of this ſtory, and apply this dayes worke in theſe uſes: Firſt in contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Aequator</hi> (my heart) ſtated in the midſt of my body. Chriſt the Sunne infuſed therein by the Spirit of God, making (ſo long as I live in this vale of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, if it were poſſible) my ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and civill actions of even di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, both in the ſervice of God and duties of my calling, that I may endevour truely to worſhip and ſerve God in ſpirit and body, which are both Gods workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. And if on either ſide it ſhould exceed, not to bee as on this day,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:58256:58"/> the moſt part in the dark night of mens traditions, and newly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the day of ſpiritual illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, but rather that the night of cloudy ſhadowes ſhould vaniſh and give place to the day of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall verities: Yet I doe conceive it requiſite and very fit that in the Church and ſervice of God there ſhould be decent, comely and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent comformity and uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty uſed and exerciſed therein by all, to expreſſe and make manifeſt our profeſſion before men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in invocation to God, that it would pleaſe him to ſend downe into my heart the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his love (the Holy Ghoſt) to aſſure me by manifeſt ſignes and tokens ſet down in his Word, that Chriſt is formed in my ſoule, that the Lord of life rules in the trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle of my heart, that the Sonne of God is conceived in my minde, that ſo beleeving the truth of this dayes commemoration, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:58256:58"/> in my heart the operation of this heavenly work, I may now (as the year) begin to ſpring and grow in all pious and commendable qualities, to the praiſe and glory of God, the comfort of others, and endleſſe ſalvation of my owne ſoule. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>THus (though ruggedly) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving finiſhed the outward Court of this beautifull Fabrick, I ſhould now begin to garniſh the Inner or Middle Temple, and therein diſplay the laborious acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the glorious High Prieſt.

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:58256:59"/> daring further to proceed, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering my owne poverty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiencie for the performance thereof, eſpecially in the very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance the ſplendor of this radiant Sunne did ſo dazle the eye of my underſtanding, that I was reſolved to reſt my ſelfe in the door of this Tabernacle; for I doe humbly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that I am not inriched with the pure gold of divine lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, nor the fine ſilk of ſweet elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, but yet (I praiſe God for it) I am indued with ſome confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed notions, as unhew'd timber, ragged expreſſions, as Badgers skins, and rough invention, as Camels haire, which were of ſome uſe in the Tabernacle, as well as gold, purple ſilke, and fine linnen: therefore having laid the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this worke, and reared it up to the firſt ſtory, I would not be accounted a fooliſh builder, to leave off in the middle of my worke: ſo though I have not ſuch
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:58256:59"/> elegant expreſſions and learned diviſions as the learned, yet I will aſſay to make a courſe peece of worke thereof: And though I have not ſuch Eagles eyes as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Divinity of this glorious Sunne, yet being covered with the vaile of humanity, my tender weak eyes may looke upon him, and ſee him as on this day to ariſe in the firmament of his Church, as the <hi>Sun of righteouſneſſe, with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling under his wings;</hi> for <hi>Salvation ſprung from on high this day hath viſitedus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as the Sunne, I will here write of him in thoſe uſuall names by which the Sun is called; which will lively demonſtrate the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative nature of either, if my dark expreſſions do not too much ecclipſe their luſtre. The naturall Sun is called by foure names: <hi>Sol, Apollo, Phoebus</hi> and <hi>Titan.</hi> Firſt, he is called <hi>Sol,</hi> becauſe he appeares alone. All other lights vaniſh at
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:58256:60"/> his preſence. There is but one Sun in the Firmament, ſo likewiſe Chriſt is the only begotten Sonne of God by eternall generation: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are the ſons of God by adop<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion. He the holy one of God, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven holineſſe it ſelfe in the ab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtract; others are holy by donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the concrete. He the onely Saviour of mankinde, no ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but by him: he the only inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor and mediator between God and man, excluding Saints and Angels. He <hi>the light</hi> that came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, without whom is darkneſſe. In briefe he is the only King that governs, defends, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects the Saints, the only Prieſt that offered himſelfe a Sacrifice for the redemption of mankinde, and the only Prophet that ſhewes the way of ſalvation to his choſen: ſo equivalent to <hi>Sol.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the naturall Sunne is called <hi>Apollo</hi> the God of wiſdome, knowledge, and learning. He that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:58256:60"/> was famous in his time for Muſick, Phyſick, Poetry, and Divination: ſo in like manner Chriſt is the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall wiſdome of the Father, &amp; the fountain of al heavenly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the true Phyſitian of the ſoule, the good Samaritan that binds up the broken hearted, heals the afflicted ſpirit, and mollifies the hard diſpoſitions of mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved nature frozen in ſinne and wickedneſſe; he that only can make the ſad heart rejoyce, and make mercy the diſconſolate ſoul, whoſe ſoule-raviſhing parables, anſwers, and doctrines, were ſuch as never man ſpake, of whoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies and divinations not one jot or tittle ſhall fall to the ground without their accompliſhment: ſo the true Prophet, and ſo divine <hi>Apollo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the naturall Sunne is called <hi>Phoebus;</hi> the ſpring of light, the diſcoverer of all things, and the expeller of darkneſſe: ſo
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:58256:61"/> Chriſt is the true light <hi>which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightneth every man that commeth into the world: of his fulneſſe we all receive</hi> the light of grace, he is the ſearcher of the heart, the tryer of our ſpirits, he knows our thoughts long before, nothing is hid from his ſight: he ſhewes the vanity of the world, the deceitfulneſſe of riches, the ſhame of pleaſure, the folly of ſport, the danger of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, inconſtancy of honour and ſtrickt account to be given for all. At his preſence all the groſſe dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of mans ignorance vaniſhes, he is the fountaine of knowledge, for all the light that all mankinde ever had, have, or ſhall have, is but as a ſpark to this Sun, or as a drop to this Ocean, ſo like <hi>Phoebus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And laſtly the Sun is called <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> for his burning heat, parching nature and revenging qualities, which he takes upon Graſſe and graine in the ſcorching Summer: ſo Chriſt the <hi>Sunne of righteouſneſſe</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:58256:61"/> in the hot Summer of the laſt judgement, <hi>when he ſhall appeare in the clouds with power and great glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> ſhall take vengeance upon his enemies, and eaſe him of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries. Then <hi>ſhall he ſpeake unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his hot diſpleaſure.</hi> Then when his wrath ſhall be kindled, and wax hot, <hi>he ſhall wound even Kings in the day of his fury with a Scepter of Iron, and break them in peeces like a pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters veſſell.</hi> Then ſhall his enemies look upon him whom they have pierced, and be confounded with ſhame, and conſumed for feare of his heavy diſpleaſure; for who is able to abide and ſtand before that conſuming fire? ſo in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect as I conceive, agreeable to <hi>Titan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now having taken a view of this glorious Sun, behold him to ariſe in the rags of our nature, out of the cloudy undefiled bed of the bleſſed Virgin, in this briefe ſtory.</p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:58256:62"/>
               <p>By conſent of all writers both Pagan, Jewiſh, and Chriſtian, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus (whom we beleeve and con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feſſe to be the true Chriſt, was borne the twenty fifth day of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 4021, in the end of the forty one yeare of the reigne of the Emperour <hi>Octavius Caeſar,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> which was fifteene yeares before his reigne ended, and in the thirty fourth yeare of <hi>Herods</hi> reigne in Jewry, when the three famous Monarchies of the <hi>Aſſyrians, Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and <hi>Grecians,</hi> was paſt over and ended, and the <hi>Romans</hi> were entred into the fourth, which was greater than any of the reſt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Daniels</hi> Prophecy, five hundred yeares before.

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58256:62"/> alone for many yeares toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in token of an univerſall peace over the whole earth, he cauſed the Temple gates of <hi>Ianus</hi> to be ſhut, according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the Romans in ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, albeit this happened but twice before from the building of Rome to that time. And the very ſame day that Chriſt was borne in Jury <hi>Auguſtus</hi> commanded in Rome (as afterward was obſerved) that no man ſhould call him Lord, thereby to ſignifie the free liberty, reſt, joy, and ſecurity wherein all men were after ſo long miſeries, which by continuall warres the world had ſuffered, to fulfill the Propheſie of <hi>Eſay</hi> above an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares before <hi>Daniel,</hi> that at the comming of Chriſt <hi>people ſhould ſit in the Tabernacle of peace in ſure dwellings and ſafe resting places.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And againe, <hi>he ſhall be called the Prince of peace,</hi> and againe, there ſhall be <hi>no end of peace;</hi> and <hi>David</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:58256:63"/> long before him, in his dayes ſhall ariſe <hi>Juſtice and abundance of peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the particular ſtate of Jewry at Chriſts Nativity, thus it was, according as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> the Iew who was borne within five yeares after Chriſts Paſſion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth the ſame.

And partly by his owne diligence and ambition, being of himſelfe both witty, beautifull, and of excellent rare qualities. By which commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, he came at length to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the daughter of <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> King of Iewry, that was deſcended line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:58256:63"/> Tribe of Iuda; and by his mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, obtained of his father in law to be Governour of the Province of Galily under him. But <hi>Hirca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> afterwards falling into the hands of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> that carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him into <hi>Parthia, Herod</hi> runne away to Rome, and there by the eſpeciall helpe and favour of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony,</hi> that ruled together in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with <hi>Octavius,</hi> he obtained to be created King of Iury, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any title or intereſt in the world, for that not only his ſaid father in law <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> was yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live in <hi>Parthia,</hi> but alſo his youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger brother <hi>Ariſtolulus,</hi> and three of his ſonnes, named <hi>Antigonus, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> and <hi>Ariſtobulus,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others of the blood royall in Iewry. <hi>Herod</hi> then by this means having obtained that Kingdome: procured firſt to have in his hands the foreſaid <hi>Hyrcanus,</hi> and ſo put him to death: he alſo brought to the ſame end, his younger brother

He killed the chiefe of the ſect of the Phariſees.

He tranſlated the high Prieſthood and ſold it to ſtrangers, and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he ſo raced, diſperſed, and mangled the houſe of Juda, as not one jot of government, dignity, or principality remained therein. And when he had done all this, then was Ieſus of the ſame houſe and line of Iuda, borne in Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem the proper City of <hi>David,</hi> which <hi>David</hi> was the founder and firſt author of regality in <hi>Juda.</hi> Now then conſider the propheſie of <hi>Iacoh,</hi> concerning the particular time of Chriſts appearance, almoſt two thouſand yeares before theſe things fell out, <hi>Come hither my children,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>that I may tell you the things which are to happen in the latter dayes, &amp;c.

The atteſtation of Oracles, the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Rabbins, and expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the Jewes at that time, but I intend brevity; and this is elſe-where learnedly deſcribed by divers famous Writers. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I conclude, as Saint <hi>Luke</hi> declares it in the ſecond Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 1. It was (ſaith he) when <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus Caeſar</hi> cauſed the whole world to bee taxed, by taking of every perſon in all places a penny, wherby they might profeſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſubject to the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and he might know how many Townes, Cities, and perſons were in the whole world under his dominion, and never till then was the like done.

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:58256:66"/> and Head, people of all Nations throughout the world are united in humble obedience to him their Soveraign.

Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaith, The Birth of Chriſt was a common Feaſt for all creatures: Angels came ſinging, the Stars run about the heavens; the <hi>Magi</hi> are brought from the Gentiles, and the earth receiveth him in a Cave. <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> ſaith, That becauſe <hi>Joſeph</hi> had no place to turne into Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem,

But whether it was an Inne, or a Cave within or without the City, it is not materiall: yet this ſhewes the poverty of the Virgin and her Spouſe, that they were not able to make any great proviſion.

               </head>
               <p>AFter you have taken a view of the Sacrifice prepared (<hi>A Lambe ſlain from the beginning</hi>) you may bee pleaſed to behold how the Prieſt begins to draw its blood with the ſharpe knife of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law (as on this day) which
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:58256:70"/> may very wel be compared to the Moon from her foure-fold nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Firſt ſhee is called <hi>Lucina,</hi> or <hi>Luna,</hi> becauſe ſhee is a light which appears in the dark night: ſo the Ceremoniall Law was as a Light in the night of ignorance, when all the world was in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. God ſeparated the Jewes to himſelfe, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>God hath given Lawes unto Iacob, his ſtatutes and ordinances unto Iſrael: hee hath not dealt ſo with any other nation, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have the Heathen knowledge of his Lawes.</hi> Secondly, the Moone is called <hi>Cynthia,</hi> which was an high hill in <hi>Delos,</hi> that ſhadowed the whole Iland: So theſe Lawes were but the <hi>ſhadowes of good things to come,</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h: They were all under a cloud, but <hi>now the vaile is taken away,</hi> the <hi>partition wall is broken:</hi> The Sun appeares, the ſhadowes vaniſh, and ſaving knowledge is apparent to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the world, that doe not
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:58256:70"/> wilfully ſhut their eyes againſt that light. Thirdly, the Moone is called <hi>Phoebe,</hi> to ſignifie (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) that all the ſplendor and brightneſſe ſhe hath it is from the Sun: So theſe legall Ceremonies came from the <hi>Son of righteouſneſſe,</hi> the wiſdome of the Father, God Almighty commanded, inſtituted and ordained them: It alſo ſhewes that they are true light, though dim and darke. And laſt of all, the Moone is called <hi>Diana,</hi> the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe of Chaſtitie to ſhew her ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity &amp; purity: ſo likewiſe theſe ceremonies in themſelves were harmleſſe and undefiled, but may bee abuſed as they are uſed. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken a view of the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor, ſee it in the thing it ſelfe. Circumciſion is the cutting off the foreskin of mans fleſh, which in Latine is called <hi>Praeputium,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God would have <hi>Abraham</hi> and his poſterity diſtinguiſhed from other Nations, and therefore was
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:58256:71"/> called the ſigne of the Covenant betweene God and his people; which was to bee performed the eight day after the birth of the child, and they that refuſed to be circumciſed, were to bee out off from the living, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of which Law was to ſignifie, that all that is begotten of man is corrupt and muſt bee mortified. Now becauſe Chriſt, as on this day, ſubjected himſelf to this Law. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> writes, that the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of <hi>Ebion</hi> and <hi>Cerinthus</hi> gather from hence that Chriſtians ought to be circumciſed, becauſe the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple ought to be as his maſter is. But he confutes them thus: Chriſt was not circumciſed as a meere Man, as they hold, but being God, he came downe from heaven, by taking the true nature of man, and was circumciſed, that this figure might appeare to have the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all effect from him, that from thenceforth not figures any more,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:58256:71"/> but the truth might be divulged by him, and his Diſciples. Hee was circumciſed for many cauſes. Firſt, that he might ſhew the truth of his fleſh againſt the <hi>Manichees.</hi> Secondly, that it might appeare, that his Humanity was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiall with his Divinity, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Apollinaris.</hi> Thirdly, that he brought it not from heaven, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Valentinus.</hi> Fourthly, that he might confirme Circumciſion, which did ſerve as a figure of his comming. And laſtly, that the Jew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s might have no excuſe left unto them: for if he had not been circumciſed, they might have ſaid, they could not receive a Chriſt uncircumciſed. <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith, As we dye with Chriſt dying, and riſe with Chriſt riſing; ſo wee are cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed with Chriſts Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, ſo that we need not now to be circumciſed. <hi>Beda</hi> renders the reaſon thus, Chriſt was circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to commend unto us the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:58256:72"/> of obedience by his owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and that in compaſſion he might helpe thoſe, that being ſet under the Law, were not able to beare the yoake of the Law, and thus hee which came in the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſinfull fleſh, doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the remedy, whereby ſinfull fleſh was wont to bee cleanſed, there being the ſame remedie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the wound of originall ſin in Circumciſion, which is now in Baptiſme; for as <hi>Athanaſ.</hi> ſaith, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe was figured out by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, but the ſpoiling of the old generation, in that part of the body was cut away which was the cauſe of generation: Therefore Chriſt being without originall ſin, needed not to be circumciſed, but onely to commend obedience by his example, and to take away the yoke of the Law. For our ſakes only hee was circumciſed in his fleſh, that we in him might be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed in ſpirit; and <hi>Cyril</hi> ſaith,

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:58256:73"/> reſtore them to their old and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient poſſeſſion of Iewry, which is the chiefe benefit they expect by the Meſſias: which is true in a ſpirituall ſenſe. And the expreſſe name of Ieſus was propheſied long before Chriſt, as it is to be ſeene in the ſecond book of <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dras;</hi> which though it be not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall, yet it is allowed for a good book, in theſe words of God the Father. Behold, the time ſhall come when the ſigne ſhall appear that I have told, &amp;c. And my ſon Ieſus ſhall be revealed, with theſe who are with him. And after thoſe dayes my ſonne Chriſt ſhall dye, and the earth ſhall render thoſe that ſleepe therein. So now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken a view of the old Law, let us look into the new: and the rather, becauſe this day is called New-yeares-day, the beginning of the Iulian yeare. And the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament that came in place of the old is called the Sacrament of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:58256:73"/> the beginning or entrance into a holy profeſſion. And it is as a moſt effectuall pledge and witneſſe of our renewing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring by Chriſt, as it is well ſet downe in our Common Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme in theſe words. For we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by nature borne in ſin and the children of wrath, are by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious blood of Chriſt made the children of grace; which is lively repreſented in the element of water: for as water purifieth the uncleanneſſe of the body, ſo (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>The blood of Chriſt cleanſeth us from all ſinne: for wee are buried with Chriſt in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</hi> That is, he hath by his death ſo fully ſatisfied for our ſins, that by his mighty power ſin is dead in them that lay hold on him by a true and a lively faith, which with repentance is required in perſons to be baptized: for the efficacy of Chriſts blood ſignified by the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of water in Baptiſme, is not
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:58256:74"/> only to ſet before our eyes the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation and purgation from ſinne, but alſo to demonſtrate our live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood and growth in grace; for ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, that <hi>like as Chriſt was raiſed from the dead to the glory of the Father, ſo we alſo ſhould w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Therefore I conclude with the prayer for the day, which I finde excellently fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to my hand in theſe words.

               <p>IN time of the ceremonial Law, the Paſchall Lambe was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to bee roſted with fire, dreſſed and prepared with ſowre hearbs, to be a fitting ſacrifice to God for the people. And Chriſt the true Paſchall Lambe in accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment thereof, throughout the whole courſe of his life was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually broyled in the fire of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and ſeaſoned with the ſowre revilings and bitter taunts of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious men, that he might become a pleaſant ſacrifice to God his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Now as the Planet <hi>Mars</hi> is three yeares before he accompliſh or fulfill his celeſtiall race, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Chriſt in the race or circuit of his miniſteriall office was three yeares, <hi>viz.</hi> from the one and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:58256:78"/> yeare of his age to his death. And as <hi>Mars,</hi> though in himſelfe inoffenſive, yet oppoſed by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary aſpects, proves fatall; ſo Chriſt, if well placed in pious hearts, governes his choſen with the ſweet influences of his grace but if oppoſed by malicious wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked hearts, hee turnes into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming fire. Hee is as a good Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine over his ſouldiers to keepe them in good order, as a ſhepherd over his flock, to bring thoſe that obey him into a ſafe harbour and pleaſant paſtures; But proves a ſevere Judge againſt thoſe that will not be governed by him. And laſtly, though the Planet <hi>Mars</hi> be never ſo much oppoſed, doth not give over his race, but holds out to the end; ſo Chriſt notwithſtanding all oppoſition that ever could be made againſt him by men, as Jews, Prieſts, and <hi>Herod,</hi> or devils, as on this day; yet hee continued his courſe, and vanquiſhed and runne
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:58256:78"/> over all, even ſin, death and hell. For the Faſt of Chriſt at this time is ſo well and learnedly written by many, that ſhould I adventure to write any thing thereof, or any thing elſe but what I find writ in learned Authors, I ſhould too much blaze my owne ignorance. Therefore I will briefly write of the Life and Actions of Chriſt, as they are learnedly deſcribed for the confirmation of the Truth, in theſe words. And firſt touching the things done by him after his comming out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> (which might bee about the ſixth or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth yeare of his age) untill his Baptiſme by Saint <hi>John,</hi> (which was the thirtieth, and as ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme upon the ſeventh of October in the middle of the laſt weeke ſpoken of by <hi>Daniel, cap.</hi> 9.) there is little recorded, either in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane or Eccleſiaſticall Writers: for that as Saint <hi>Iuſtine,</hi> Saint <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome,</hi> Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and others
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:58256:79"/> doe write, he beſtowed that time in the common exerciſe and labors of mans life; thereby to ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe true Man, and give demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration how much he deteſted &amp; hated idleneſſe. But after his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, <hi>viz.</hi> when he was paſt thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeares of age, (for hee was full thirty the twenty five of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) becauſe it was not lawfull for any to be admitted into the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry before they were ſo old, <hi>Num.</hi> 4. he began to preach in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of January and February, and his whole doctrine was directed to the manifeſtation of his Fathers will, and amendment of mans life. It tendeth all to this one ground and principle, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy ſoule, and thy neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> It was plain, eaſie, perſpicuous and evident, though it treated of moſt high myſteres. It had neither pompe nor pride of rhetorical words, nor flattering of mans wickedneſſe, as
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:58256:79"/> the doctrine of many Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers had, neither conſiſted it in unprofitable externall ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, (as the later obſervation of the Jewiſh Law did) nor was fraught with carnality and ſpirit of this world; as the Turkiſh Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran, and other ſectaries doctrine is. But all was ſimplicity, all was ſpirit, all was truth, all was hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, all was humility, all was cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. It tooke away or diſanulled no one perfect or ſpirituall point of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, but rather revived, interpreted, fulfilled and made perfect the ſame. For whereas that commanded external obſervance, this addeth alſo internall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: whereas that ſaid, <hi>Love your friends;</hi> this adjoyneth, <hi>Love alſo your enemies:</hi> wheras that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded wee ſhould not kill, this further commandeth to ſpeake no angry words: whereas that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited actuall adultery; this alſo forbiddeth to coyet in the mind:
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:58256:80"/> whereas that ſayd, Take no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt or uſury of a Jew that is thy country man; this ſaith, take it of no man whatſoever: whereas that accounted every Jew onely to be thy neighbor; this teacheth every perſon living to be thy brother: whereas that taught thee to offer up a calfe, a ſheepe, or an oxe for thy ſins; this inſtructeth thee, to offer up a contrite heart by faith in the blood of him that dyed for all, with a firme and reſolute pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of amendment of life. And finally, this doctrine tendeth whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the true, ſincere, and perfect ſervice of God thy Lord, that made and redeemed thee, to the exaltation of his onely Name, Power, Goodneſſe and Glory; to the depreſſion of mans pride, by the diſcovering his miſery; to the contempt of this world and vaine pompe thereof; to the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſubduing of our fleſhly appetite; to the true and unfained
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:58256:80"/> charity of our neighbour; to the ſtirring up of our ſpirit to celeſtial cogitations; to peace of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, tranquillity of minde, purity of body, conſolation of our ſoul, and in one word, to reduce man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde againe to a certaine eſtate of innocency, ſimplicity, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall ſanctity upon earth, with his eye fixed only in the eternall inheritance of Gods kingdome in heaven.</p>
               <p>This was the doctrine delivered by Jeſus: which is the ſame that the Prophets foretold ſhould be delivered by the Meſſias. And for his life and converſation, by the teſtimony of his greateſt adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, it was more admirable then his doctrine; his life being a moſt lively table, wherein the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all his doctrine was expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, a man of ſuch gravity as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in his life was noted to laugh: of ſuch humility as being the Son of God, he ſcarce uſed in this
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:58256:81"/> world the dignity of a ſervant; of ſuch ſweet and milde behaviour, as all the injuries of his enemies never wreſted from him one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry word. Finally he was ſuch an one as he was deſcribed by <hi>Eſay</hi> many ages before he was borne, in theſe words; <hi>he ſhall not cry nor contend, neither ſhall any man heare his voice in the ſtreets: a bruiſed reed he ſhall not breake, nor the ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king flax hee will not quench, &amp;c</hi> And as his <hi>life and converſation</hi> was foretold by Prophets, ſo his mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous works alſo were foretold by the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> &amp; others, w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> did conſiſt of internall, and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall acts. For firſt the calling and retaining of his Apoſtles and other followers, who were of divers callings, ſtates, conditions, trades, and occupations in the world. And yet all upon the ſudden left both father and mother, wife, children, and other temporall reſpects, and followed him who had nothing
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:58256:81"/> to give or promiſe them in this world. A man that never ſpake them fair, or uttered doctrine that was not repugnant to the ſenſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this life, as may appeare by their owne writings and teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of him. A man that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned by the better ſort, as then it might ſeeme; that is, by the wiſe and learned of that countrey, and eſpecially diſliked by them that were in government as a dangerous and troubleſome man to the ſtate, one that had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther friends to beare him out, nor a houſe to put his head in. And yet, notwithſtanding all this, that worldly men and women and ſome ſuch alſo as were great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, &amp; looſe livers before ſhould leave all their worldly hope, ſtay and condition, to follow ſuch a man, with ſo great inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, loſſes, dangers, and disfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours as they did; and ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue with him in all his afflictions,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:58256:82"/> and be content to dye and loſe their lives rather then forſake him or abondon his ſervice. This (I ſay) is ſuch a miracle, as never in the world fell out the like, and muſt needs bee granted by his chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>feſt enemies to be ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. The ſecond point is of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall things and facts done by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, above all power of humane ability, in the ſight &amp; knowledge of all the Jewes; which facts were publiſhed by our Evangeliſts, and eſpecially by Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> in the Hebrew tongue, while yet the perſons were alive, upon whom they were wrought, or infinite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that might be witneſſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. As for example, the raiſing of <hi>Lazar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi> in <hi>Bethania,</hi> that was a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage but a mile or two diſtant from Ieruſalem, at whoſe death and buriall, (being a Gentleman) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Scribes and Phariſees muſt needs be preſent (according to the Iewiſh cuſtome at that time) and
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:58256:82"/> they ſaw him both deceaſed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred, and the funerall feaſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for him, as alſo raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine from death by Ieſus, after foure dayes of his buriall, with whom they did eat and drink, and converſe after his returne to life, and every day might behold him walking up and downe in the ſtreets of Ieruſalem. This ſtory could not be feined. So in like manner the raiſing of the Archi-Synagogues daughter, whoſe name is affirmed to be <hi>Iairus,</hi> with divers other circumſtances that do make the thing moſt notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. The raiſing of the widowes ſonne before the gate of the City <hi>Naim,</hi> in the prefence of all the people that bore the ſaid corps, and ſtood about it; the healing of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he Cripple in Ieruſalem, that had laine thirty and eight yeares lame, at the Pooles ſide or Bath called <hi>Probatica,</hi> which miracle was done alſo in the ſight of infinite people.
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:58256:83"/> The caſting out a legion of devils from a man that for many yeares was knowne to live in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, the feeding and filling of five thouſand men beſide women and children at one time, and four thouſand at another, with a ſmall parcell of bread and a few fiſhes. The turning of water into wine at a mariage in <hi>Cana,</hi> in the preſence of all the gheſts, the healing of him by a word only that had an incurable dropſie, and this at the table of a principall Phariſee and in the ſight of all that ſate at din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with him; the giving ſight to him that was borne blinde well knowne to many. Theſe and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other ſuch miracles which were done in the ſight and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of an infinite number of people and recorded by our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts, at ſuch times when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deſired to diſcredit the ſame, and might have done eaſily by many witneſſes and authority. If
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:58256:83"/> any one part thereof had beene ſubject to calumniation; cannot in reaſon or probability be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of. And laſt of all (though more occult and ſecret) yet not the leaſt, but rather the greateſt miracle that ever Chriſt did in his life is his faſting forty dayes and forty nights, typified in the faſt of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> recorded by three Evangeliſts for confirmation of the truth thereof. And all that while was tempted of the Devill, as S. <hi>Luke</hi> expreſſely ſaith, being forty dayes tempted of the devill, yet ſome thinke hee endured all thoſe ſharpe temptations in one day, whom in the end he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came with his own weapons. And this hapned upon him preſently after he was baptized of <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,</hi> ſo ſaith S. <hi>Marke, Immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe.</hi> And I note it the rather, becauſe it is the uſuall cuſtome of Sathan now in theſe dayes to
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:58256:84"/> deale with the ſervants as he dealt with the Lord. As ſoone as they begin to conſecrate their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to the ſervice of God, the devill by the winde of promotion, the allurements of pleaſures, or ſpur of worldly profit drives them into the wilderneſſe of worldly affaires, where they remaine long ere they can get out of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanglements of many thorny cares and anxieties of minde. How this wilderneſſe was called, the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt doth not ſpecifie: but it is thought to bethe deſert of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And upon the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of November hungred. And then the devill with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary boldneſſe carried him from mount <hi>Sina</hi> with great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence through the aire, and ſet him upon the top of a pinacle of the temple, which was ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing high that whoſoever looked downe from it into the valley of Cedron, their eyes daz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

From this place the devill bad our Saviour throw himſelfe downe, after the devill ſet Chriſt upon an exceeding high mountaine: but what hill it was or how it was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the Evangeliſt doth not ſet
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:58256:85"/> downe, but it is to be thought, it was the high mountaine <hi>Nebo,</hi> which was alſo called <hi>Piſgah,</hi> and ſtood twenty foure miles from Ieruſalem Eaſtward where God ſhewed unto <hi>Moſes</hi> all the land of Canaan beyond Iordan. And in this place the devill ſhewed our Saviour the Kingdomes of the world and the glory of them; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>All theſe will I give thee, &amp;c.</hi> Now our Church hath piouſly ſet a part this annuall faſt to begin as on this day in commemoration of that faſt of our Saviour: for by our conformity we ſhew whoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants we are, even his whoſe works we imitate, and that abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from uſuall repaſt might be a meanes to quicken our reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt the receiving of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper at Eaſter; for though faſting in it ſelfe be no religious act in which the immediate worſhip of God conſiſts, <hi>For the kingdome of God</hi>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:58256:85"/> (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>conſiſteth not in meat and drinke,</hi> yet it is a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous act as acceſſary to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſerving as a help or prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to faith, prayer, &amp;c. And ſo may be called a good work. And therefore in all Churches and in all Ages ſince the Apoſtles time, it hath beene piouſly obſerved, as is learnedly demonſtrated in divers treatiſes extant in Engliſh. Now why this day is called Aſhwedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day is, for that the Chriſtians in the Primitive times retained ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Heathens and Jewiſh ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, as <hi>Iobs</hi> friends ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led duſt upon their heads towards heaven; the King of Nineveh and Queen <hi>Eſther,</hi> with the Iewes, ſate in aſhes to expreſſe their ſorrow: ſo they to expreſſe their own vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and unworthineſſe caſt aſhes on their heads. But this was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary ceremony, and therfore in the reformed Churches well diſmiſſed. So now I conclude this
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:58256:86"/> dayes meditation with that divine prayer of Doctor <hi>Featelies</hi> in theſe words. <hi>Oh let not my Lord be angry,</hi> that I who am <hi>but duſt and aſhes dare ſpeak unto him:</hi> for my ſins <hi>cry for vengeance,</hi> and ſhall I be ſilent for pardon? <hi>Gracious God,</hi> either ſilence them, or heare me. If thou wilt not heare the voice of my words, heare the <hi>voice of my tears:</hi> if thou wilt not heare them, heare the voice of thy ſonnes <hi>blood which ſpeaketh better things then the blood of Abel.</hi> I confeſſe I have ſorely diſpleaſed thee, but it troubleth me that I have ſo <hi>incenſed</hi> thee; I have <hi>grieved thy Spirit,</hi> but it <hi>grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth</hi> me that I ſhould be ſo <hi>grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe</hi> as to <hi>grieve</hi> that <hi>Spirit of grace,</hi> which <hi>ſealeth thy choſen to ſalvation.</hi> I deſerve that thou ſhouldeſt even abhorre me for my ſinnes, but I <hi>abhorre my ſelfe</hi> for them in <hi>duſt and aſhes.</hi> I have offended thee in glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, but I now faſt for it; in pride, but I humble my ſelfe; in laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

Thou didſt not <hi>break a bruiſed reed,</hi> wilt thou grinde to powder a <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken heart? What profit is in my blood O Lord, when I goe downe into the pit? Nay what profit is in thy blood O bleſſed Redeemer,</hi> if they for whom it was ſhed <hi>goe downe into the pit</hi> of deſtruction? <hi>ſhall the duſt give thanks unto thee O Lord,</hi> or the aſhes and cinders of hell praiſe the God of heaven? <hi>Heare O Lord and have mercy upon me, thou that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt thoſe that are broken in heart, and giveſt medicine to cure their ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> raiſe up my proſtrate and dejected ſoule.

               </head>
               <p>HAving in the former medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhewed you an imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate Lambe and the firſt fruits of the meritorious blood thereof, then how the ſaid Lambe was prepared to be a fitting Sacrifice for the expiation of the ſins of the whole world, Now I ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my promiſe in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of this work, ſhow you how this Sacrifice was laid upon the Altar of the Croſſe as on this day, under the metaphor of the Planet Saturne. But herein I perceive my owne inability and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I ſhould dare to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon ſuch holy things in ſuch vile compariſons, for the expulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saturne out of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome by his brother Titan, and
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:58256:89"/> ſonne Jupiter, is no way equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to the malice of the Jewes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our bleſſed Saviour. For Saturne broke covenant with his brother, and kept three of his male children alive, contrary to the condition which he held his kingdome by. And therefore Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan had juſt cauſe to make warre againſt him, and recover his inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance due to the firſt borne. And Jupiter likewiſe did expell his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of his kingdome, becauſe his father threatned to kill him. But Chriſt had done offence to none, he had broken no bonds, but rather made up the breach; hee was ſo farre from deſtroying that he came on purpoſe to ſave and redeeme that which was loſt. And what were the troubles of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne King of Creet, to the unſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable ſufferings of Chriſt the King of glory? Nay what were all the troubles of all the men that are or ever were in the world, to
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:58256:89"/> the troubles of our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our? And where is the patience of Saturne, <hi>Iob,</hi> or any other that was in Chriſt? For as the light of the natural Sun is darkneſſe, to the Splendor of the Sunne of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe; ſo all the excellency and worth that is in all mankind is not able fully to demonſtrate the excellencie that is in Chriſt: yet becauſe <hi>Saturne</hi> was impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by his Brother, and driven out of his Kingdome by his own ſonne; I did intend to ſhew how our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour, as on this day was bound &amp; impriſoned by the cruell Jews his brethren according to the fleſh, of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of the Kingdome of this world, by thoſe which ſhould as obedient children to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mands of God their Father, have kept their hands from killing the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. But being conſcious of my owne inſufficiency for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of ſuch a work, it being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:58256:90"/> deſcribed by many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and learned men; I will only write the briefe ſtory thereof, as I find it in a book entitled <hi>Itinerari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um totius Sacrae Scripturae,</hi> in theſe words. After that our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour had eaten the Paſchal Lamb according to the Law, which was the fourth Paſſeover that he kept with his Diſciples; and in ſtead thereof had inſtituted and ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Sacrament of his bleſſed Body and Blood in that his laſt Supper, which was about ſix or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the clocke in the evening, upon Thurſday the ſecond day of April juſt at the beginning of the fourteenth day of the firſt moneth <hi>Abib</hi> or <hi>Niſan,</hi> which began about the evening of this day, he waſhed his Diſciples feet, and leaning up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Table, pointed out <hi>Judas</hi> that ſhould betray him: from the ninth houre to the tenth, about the ſecond watch of the night, <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> that Traytor went from his
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:58256:90"/> Diſciples. In the mean time Chriſt made that long Sermon recited only by <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 15, 16. and made that effectuall prayer, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the tenth houre (after they had ſung à Pſalme) Chriſt went over the brooke Kedron, to the Garden of Gethſemane, being ſomewhat more than halfe a mile, there betweeen the houres of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and twelve, hee ſweat water and blood, and prayed earneſtly. About twelve of the clock, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then midnight, Chriſt was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed by <hi>Iudas,</hi> who about three dayes before had ſold him for thirty ſilverlings, which was worth about three pound fifteene ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. From Gethſemane the Jews brought him bound to Jeruſalem, and about one of the clocke in the morning carried him to the houſe of <hi>Annas,</hi> who was one of the chief Prieſts. About two of the clocke they led him from thence to <hi>Caia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas</hi> cheife Prieſt, from three of
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:58256:91"/> the clocke till foure (which was about the Cock's crowing) <hi>Peter</hi> denyed Chriſt. At the ſame time <hi>Caiaphas</hi> and all the Rulers of the people in Jeruſalem, would have condemned the Lord of Glory, the Sonne of God. At the ſame time alſo the ſervants and officers of the Prieſts beat him and mocked him. About five of the clocke in he morning Chriſt was condemned by the whole conſent of Synedri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Jewes. All theſe things Chriſt ſuffered between Thurſday and Friday. And whereas the Jews according to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of God begin their day in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, therefore that night wherein our Saviour ſuffered all theſe things, belonged to the fourteenth day of the month <hi>Abib;</hi> ſo that juſt at the ſame time as the Feaſt of the Paſchal Lambe was celebrated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Jews, Chriſt the Lamb of God was made a living ſacrifice on the Croſſe for the ſins of man.
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:58256:91"/> Thus we have obſerved the hours of the night, ſo likewiſe let us ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the houres of the day. Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day being the third day of April (which, as I have ſaid, began the evening before) was the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of the firſt month <hi>Abib</hi> or <hi>Niſan,</hi> among the Jewes, at ſix of the clock in the morning, about Sunne riſing of the ſame day, our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt was brought unto <hi>Pilate,</hi> and <hi>Judas Iſcariot</hi> han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himſelfe, becauſe he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed innocent blood. About ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the clock in the ſame mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, our Saviour was carried to <hi>Herod Antipas,</hi> that cruell Tyrant, (who the yeare before had put <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> to death) where hee was diſdainfully handled; but <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> and he were made friends. At eight of the clock our Saviour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Pilate,</hi> who propounded unto the Jewes (becauſe they were to have a capitall offender delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto them at the Feaſt of the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:58256:92"/> Paſſeover) whether they would have Jeſus their King, or <hi>Barabbas,</hi> who had beene a murtherer, let looſe unto them? But they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Jeſus, and choſe <hi>Barabbas,</hi> whoſe name ſignifies the ſon of the Multitude, or a ſeditious man. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout nine of the clock in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (which the Jewes commonly call the third houre of the day, becauſe it ſucceeded the morning, and continued till noone) our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt was whipt and crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with thornes. About ten of the clock <hi>Pontius Pilat</hi> in the place called <hi>Gabbatha,</hi> publiquely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Chriſt to be crucified, and waſhed his hands in token of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency. <hi>Pontius</hi> ſignifies cruell and inhumane, <hi>Pilat</hi> a man armed with a Roman dart. Between ten and eleven our Saviour Chriſt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying his Croſſe, was brought to the place called <hi>Golgotha.</hi> About eleven of the clocke (the third houre of the morning being not
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:58256:92"/> yet fully finiſhed) our Saviour Chriſt was faſtened upon the Croſſe, where hee hung foure houres, <hi>viz.</hi> from eleven till about three of the clocke in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone. And he ſpake before that ſupernaturall eclipſe of the Sunne three memorable ſayings: Firſt, <hi>Father forgive them, for they know not what they doe:</hi> Secondly, he ſaid to his Mother, <hi>Woman behold thy Sonne:</hi> And to <hi>Iohn</hi> being conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Behold thy Mother.</hi> Thirdly, to the Theefe: <hi>Verily I ſay unto thee, this day thou ſhalt be with me in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.</hi> About twelve of the clocke (in that meridian which the Jewes call the ſixt houre, that is, the ſixt houre from the riſing of the Sun) that ſupernaturall eclipſe of the Sun happened, of which you may reade in <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> the Areopagite, and <hi>Euſebius.</hi> About three of the clocke in the afternoone, which the Jews call the ninth houre (the Sun now beginning to receive his
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:58256:93"/> light) our Saviour ſpake theſe foure ſayings, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Secondly, <hi>I thirſt.</hi> Thirdly, when he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the ſpong, he ſaid, <hi>It is finiſhed:</hi> and laſt of all, crying out with a loud voice, he ſaid, <hi>Futher into thy hands I commend my Spirit,</hi> and ſo dyed. At which time there were many wonderfull miracles wrought, as you may reade, <hi>Mat. 27. Mark 15. Luke 23. Iohn</hi> 19. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout foure of the clock in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoone our bleſſed Saviour was pierced thorow with a lance, and there iſſued out of his ſide water and blood. About five of the clock (which the Iewes call the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth houre of the day) our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt was buried by <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> and <hi>Nichodemus.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſixth houre there was an eclipſe of the Moone, which was naturall, and not miraculous; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it obſerved by any of the Evangeliſts.</p>
               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:58256:93"/>
               <p>Upon the fifteenth of the firſt month, which anſwereth to the fourth of April (being juſtly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the great and holy Sabbath of the Iewes, for that Chriſt this day reſted in the Sepulchre) the Prieſts and Phariſees being partly joyfull, becauſe (as they thought) the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturber of the common peace, and one that oppoſed their authority was dead, and partly carefull how they might prevent his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, went to <hi>Pilate</hi> and obtained of him a band of ſouldiers to watch the Sepulchre, and to put his ſeale upon the ſtone. Now as at the Birth of Chriſt I writ what I found concerning the manger, in which Chriſt was laid, when hee was borne: ſo I thought it not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe to ſet downe the deſcription of the Sepulchre, in which he was laid, when he was dead, as I finde it in the forenamed book in theſe words: The ſepulchre of Chriſt ſtood upon the weſt ſide of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:58256:94"/> cloſe by Mount Golgotha, in the garden of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of Arima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea: for it was the cuſtome of the Iewes to build their tombes or ſepulchres in their Orchards and gardens, and beautifie and adorne them with Lillies, Roſes, and other flowers, on purpoſe to put them in mind of their mortality, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of <hi>David, The dayes of man are like graſſe, as a flower of the field ſo flouriſheth he; for the wind go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth over it, and it is gone, and the place thereof knoweth it no more.</hi> And for this cauſe the Iewes (but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Kings) would be buried in their gardens. So <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> a good and juſt man, following this cuſtome, had hewen for himſelfe out of a Rock a new monument, in which there had been no man laid; that ſo when he walked into the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to take the aire, hee might be put in minde of his mortality. In this Monument our Saviour was buried, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this place upon the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:58256:94"/> third day early in the morning, he roſe; to the terror and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch as watched the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre. From whence may bee gathered, that as our firſt Parents, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> treſpaſſed againſt God, and loſt felicity in a garden, ſo Chriſt the Son of God in a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den made ſatisfaction for that ſin, reſtored us againe to grace, and made us capable of heavenly feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. This Sepulchre (as it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> when hee went with Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to ſee if that notable miracle of the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction were true) was like a little chappell, the doore thereof being upon the outſide, and but one room without any diviſion, ſo that a man might ſee all that was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it. For he ſaith, that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> did not go in, but lookt in and ſaw the linnen cloathes where they lay wrapped up: from whence may be concluded, that the Sepulchre which is now extant (howſoever
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:58256:95"/> perhaps it may ſtand in the ſame place) is not the ſame Sepulchre wherein our Saviour Chriſt was buried: for it is deſcribed to bee foureſquare, to be open at the top, to have within two vaults, (an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and an outward) and that you deſcend to it by ſtairs: which deſcription doth not agree with Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> for hee ſaith, that they rouled a great ſtone to the dore of the Sepulchre, but did not lay it upon the top of it. And Venerable <hi>Bede,</hi> who was a Doctor of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and lived in England ſeven hundred years after Chriſt, deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth the holy Sepulchre after this manner: This Sepulchre over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head was ſomething round, and ſo high that a man could ſcarce touch it with his hand, ſtanding in that Rock which extendeth it ſelf from Mount Calvary into the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of Arimathea: repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting in forme a little chappell; the entrance therinto was towards
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:58256:95"/> the Eaſt. And further he addeth, That they which went into the vaile found on the right hand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the North, a ſtone Tombe, which reſembled a coffin ſcituated in the pavement, joyning to the wall, which ſtone coffin was of a mixt colour, that is, white and red, being ſeven foot long and three handfulls high. This deſcription Venerable <hi>Bede</hi> records from cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Monkes that went upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion to Ieruſalem to viſite this Sepulchre; but ſince it hath been divers times deſtroyed, and pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Turkes and other Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then people. From whence may be gathered, that the Sepulchre which is now ſtanding &amp; ſhewed unto Pilgrims, is ſome new device, to get money of ſtrangers, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a kinde of blind devotion in the hearts of ignorant people. Wherefore, as the Angell ſaid, <hi>Let us not ſeeke Chriſt any longer amongst the dead, or in the grave,</hi> but in his
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:58256:96"/> Holy Church, where the lively portraiture of his divine preſence is ſet forth unto us; that ſo we may be made partakers with him here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in that place of eternall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. For the confirmation of the truth of Chriſts paſſion, beſides the true relation thereof ſet downe by the foure Evangeliſts, the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of the Sibels, and conſent of the Rabbins, the holy Scriptures long before ſet downe, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets propheſied of every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular thing in our Saviours Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Firſt, that all his Diſciples ſhould forſake kim. <hi>Zachary</hi> told, <hi>That the Shepherd ſhould be ſmitten, and the ſheepe ſcattered,</hi> that one of his owne Diſciples ſhould betray him. <hi>David</hi> in the perſon of Chriſt ſaith, <hi>It was my familiar friend whom I truſted, which did eat of my bread, that lift up his heele againſt me.</hi> And <hi>Zachary</hi> makes relation of the <hi>thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty peeces of ſilver the price of him that was valued, which the children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:58256:96"/> valued, and gave for the Potters field, as the Lord appointed. Eſay</hi> in the perſon of Chriſt relates the Iews ſpitefull uſage of him in the high Prieſts Hall, and before <hi>Pilat, I gave my backe to the ſmiters, my cheekes to the nippers, and hid not my face from ſhame and ſpitting. David</hi> likewiſe in the perſon of Chriſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentably complaines, <hi>That they pierced his hands and his feet, ſo that he might tell all his bones; they ſtood ſtaring and looking upon him, they parted his ganments among them, and upon his veſture did they caſt lots. All that goe by have him in deriſion, they mow and nod the head, ſaying, He tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in God, let him deliver him if he will have him.</hi> And in another place he complaines that <hi>they gave him gall to eat, and vineger to drink.</hi> And another Prophet cryes, That <hi>they ſhall looke upon him whom they have pierced.</hi> Finally, the whole relation thereof is ſet down by the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> in his 53. Chapter,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:58256:97"/> which begins with this preface, <hi>Who will beleeve our report? or to whom is the arme of the Lord revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>The ſixth apparition was eight dayes after his reſurrection, being the twelth of Aprill, to all his Diſciples, <hi>Thomas</hi> being then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and the doores ſhut.

<pb n="292" facs="tcp:58256:108"/> ſubſtantially and effectually, not as a phantaſma or ſhadow which vaniſheth away, and is without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny corpor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>all ſubſtance, but did eat and drink, and ſuffered his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be handled by his Diſciples.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh apparition was to <hi>Peter, Thomas, Nathaneel,</hi> the ſons of <hi>Zebedeus</hi> and other two Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as they were fiſhing upon the ſhore of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> which ſtood 36 miles from Ieruſalem Northward betweene <hi>Bethſaida</hi> and <hi>Caperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, Iohn</hi> 21.</p>
               <p>The eighth was to the eleven Apoſtles on Mount <hi>Tabor</hi> in <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ninth was to more then five hundred brethren at one time, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſeth.</p>
               <p>The tenth was to <hi>James</hi> the ſon of <hi>Alpheus,</hi> for he had beene ſeene before by <hi>Iames</hi> the ſon of <hi>Zebede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> but the certaine time of theſe foure laſt apparitions is not ſet downe.</p>
               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:58256:108"/>
               <p>But on the fourteenth day of May which was forty dayes after his reſurrection, he appeared to all his Apoſtles, Diſciples, and friends together on Mount <hi>Olivet.</hi> And in their ſight with great tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph and joy he aſcended into Heaven.</p>
               <p>And laſt of all after his aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he appeared to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> as himſelfe relates. Thus (as <hi>Luke</hi> affirmeth) he ſhewed himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live by many arguments, for the ſpace of forty dayes together and reaſoned with them of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of his father.</p>
               <p>Why then ſhould any man miſtruſt the teſtimony of theſe men which ſaw him, ate with him, dranke with him, touched him, and heard him ſpeak, and whoſe entire eſtate and welfare depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded wholly of the certainety thereof?</p>
               <p>For what comfort had it beene or conſolation to thoſe men to
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:58256:109"/> have deviſed of themſelves thoſe former apparitions; what encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement might they have taken in theſe dolefull times of deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and affliction, to have had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them the dead body of him, on whoſe only life their u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſall hope and confidence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended?</p>
               <p>The Scribes and Phariſees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſtoniſhed at the ſudden news of his riſing againe, confirmed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them by their owne ſouldiers that ſaw it, found no other way to reſiſt the fame thereof, but only by ſaying (as their poſterity do at this day) that his Diſciples came by night and ſtole away his body, while the ſouldiers ſlept. But what likelyhood or poſſibility can there be in this? for firſt it is evident to all the world, that his Apoſtles themſelves (who were the heads of all the reſt, were ſo diſmaied, diſcomforted, and dejected at that time, as they durſt not once goe
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:58256:109"/> out of the doore; for which cauſe only thoſe ſilly women, who for their ſex eſteemed themſelves more free from violence, preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med alone to viſit his Sepulchre, which no one man durſt doe for feare of the ſouldiers: untill by thoſe women they were infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that the foreſaid band of ſouldiers were terrified and put to flight by Chriſts reſurrection.</p>
               <p>And then how was it likely, that men ſo much amazed and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with feare ſhould adventure to ſteale away a dead body from a guard of ſouldiers that kept it? or if their hearts had ſerved to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture ſo great a danger? what hope or probability had there beene of ſucceſſe? eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the ſaid body lay in a new Sepulchre of ſtone ſhut up, locked and faſt ſealed by the Magiſtrate? how was it poſſible I ſay, that his Diſciples ſhould come thither, break up the monument, take out
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:58256:110"/> his body, and carry away the ſame, never after to be ſeene or found without eſpiall of ſome one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſo many that attended there? or if this were poſſible (as in reaſon it is not) yet what profit, what pleaſure, what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort could they receive hereby?</p>
               <p>We ſee that theſe Apoſtles and Diſciples of his who were ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned of life and heart in his paſſion, after two dayes only they were ſo changed, as life and death cannot be more contrary: for whereas before they kept home in all feare, and durſt appeare no where, except among their owne private friends; now they came forth into the ſtreets and common places, and avouched with all ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity, and irreſiſtable conſtancy, even in the faces and hearing of their greateſt enemies, that Jeſus was riſen from death to life; that they had ſeene him, and enjoyed his preſence, and that for teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:58256:110"/> and confirmation hereof, they were moſt ready to ſpend their lives. And could all this proceed onely of a dead body, which they had gotten by ſtealth into their poſſeſſion? Would not rather the preſence and ſight of ſuch a body, ſo torne, mangled and deformed, as Jeſus body was, both upon the Croſſe and before, have rather diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid them more, than given them any comfort? Yes truly.</p>
               <p>And therefore <hi>Pilate</hi> the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, conſidering theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and that it was unlikely that either the body ſhould bee ſtolne away without privity of the ſouldiers, or if it had been, that it ſhould yeeld ſuch life, heart, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation and courage to the ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, began to give eare more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to the matter; and calling to him the ſouldiers that kept the watch, underſtood by them the whole truth of the accident, to wit, that in their ſight and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:58256:111"/> Jeſus was riſen out of his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre to life; and that at his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, there was ſo dreadfull an earth-quake, with trembling and opening of Sepulchres round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, ſuch skriches, cries and com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>motion of all eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, as they durſt not abide longer, but ran and told the Jewiſh Magiſtrates thereof, who being greatly diſcontented (as it ſeemed) gave them money to ſay that while they were ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, the body was ſtolne from them by his Diſciples.</p>
               <p>All this wrote <hi>Pilate</hi> preſently to his Lord <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who was then Emperour of Rome. And he ſent withall, the particular examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and confeſſions of divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that had ſeene and ſpoken with ſuch as were riſen from death at that time, and had appeared to many of their acquaintance in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, aſſuring them alſo of the reſurrection of Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Which information when <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
                  <pb n="299" facs="tcp:58256:111"/> the Emperor had conſidered, hee was greatly moved therewith, and propoſed to the Senate, that Jeſus might be admitted among the reſt of the Roman Gods, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his owne conſent, with the priviledge of his ſupreme royall ſuffrage to that decree: But the Senate in no wiſe would agree thereunto.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, <hi>Tiberius</hi> being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, gave licenſe to all men to beleeve in Jeſus that would, and forbid upon paine of death, that any officer or other ſhould moleſt or trouble ſuch as bare good affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, zeale, or reverence to that Name. Thus much teſtifieth <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> againſt the Gentiles, of his owne knowledge: who living in Rome a learned man, and pleader of cauſes divers yeares before hee was a Chriſtian (which was about 180. yeares after our Saviour Chriſts Aſcenſion,) had great abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie by reaſon of the honour of
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:58256:112"/> his Family, learning, and place wherein he lived, to ſee and know the Records of the Romans.</p>
               <p>Neither onely divers Gentiles had this opinion of Jeſus Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection again from death, but alſo ſundry Jewes of great credit and wiſdome, at that time, were infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to beleeve it; notwithſtanding it pleaſed not God to give them ſo much grace as to become Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
               <p>This appeareth plainly by the learned <hi>Joſephus,</hi> who writing his Story not above forty yeares after Chriſts Paſſion, tooke occaſion to ſpeake of Jeſus, and of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. And after he had ſhewed how he was crucified by <hi>Pilate</hi> at the inſtance of the Jewes, and that for all this, his Diſciples ceaſed not to love him ſtill, he adjoyneth forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with theſe words. For this love of his Diſciples, hee appeared unto them againe the third day, when he had reſumed life unto him.</p>
               <pb n="301" facs="tcp:58256:112"/>
               <p>Which expreſſe, plaine and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute words, wee may in reaſon take not as the confeſſion only of <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> but as the common judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, opinion and ſentence of all the diſcreet and ſober men of that time, laid downe and recorded by this Hiſtoriographer. In whoſe dayes there were yet many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians alive, that had ſeene and ſpoken with Jeſus after his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; and infinite Iewes, that had heard the ſame proteſted by their fathers, brethren, kinsfolke and friends, who had been them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves eye-witneſſes thereof. And thus much for the ſtory of Chriſts Reſurrection, which I conclude with this divine Prayer.</p>
               <p>Glorious <hi>Son of Righteouſneſſe,</hi> who this morning didſt prevent <hi>the dawning of the day,</hi> by ſending forth the beames of thy glorified body out of the Pit of darkneſſe and <hi>ſhadow of death,</hi> ſhine upon my ſoule by the light of this grace. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten</hi>

O how did the ſureſt ground of Faith ſhake, the ſafeſt Ancor of hope looſen, at the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake at thy death! What ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting together of knees, what wring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of hands, what knocking of breaſts, what fainting of hearts, what hanging down of heads were there at giving up of thy ghoſt, when thy head hung down on the Croſſe? With thee the faith, with thee the hope, with thee the joy, with thee the life of thy dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Diſciples might ſeeme to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. What ſhould or could the priſoners of death ever expect, when they ſaw him whom they thought to have been their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, the Lord of life arreſted by death, and kept cloſe priſoner in the grave ſo long? O death, how

But bleſſed be the Angell which removed the ſtone, and thereby made way, that <hi>the ſtone which the builders refuſed,</hi> might be preferred to be <hi>the head ſtone in the corner.</hi> Bleſſed be the right hand of thy Father, who in raiſing thee out of the grave, raiſed our hope out of the duſt: for <hi>where is our hope?

The grave by thy lying in it is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to a bed, and a withdrawing roome to retire my ſelfe a while, to put off this ragged fleſh, and attire my ſelfe with roabs of glory.

               <p>IN the old Teſtament I find that two ſeveral times fire deſcended from heaven upon ſacrifices pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for offrings of a ſweet ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſavour unto the Lord.

               <p>The other was, when <hi>Eliah</hi> for confirmation of the true religion and extirpation of idolatry called for fire from Heaven, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the ſacrifice and licked up the water in the Trench round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Altar.</p>

Therefore ſeeing I have raiſed this worke to this hight, I will not fear to ſhow that as <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark was a manifeſt ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole of the Church before and ſince the Law, upon the trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome waters of perſecution and affliction: ſo this Ark likewiſe may be a figure of Chriſts Church in the haven of proſperity and peace, ſince the Goſpell; for firſt as the Law of God was put into the Ark for a memoriall of Gods covenant betweene him and the children of Iſrael, ſo the Law or Goſpell of Chriſt hath beene preſerved in his Church, for the confirmation of the faith, and direction of the
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:58256:123"/> lives of us Chriſtians. Secondly, as Manna was kept in the Ark for a remembrance of Gods mercy and power in preſerving the lives of the Children of Iſrael forty years in the wilderneſſe with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels food, ſo likewiſe the bleſſed Sacrament of the Lords Supper, as choſen Manna, hath beene kept in Chriſts Church for the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all livelyhood of the worthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver for ever.

               <p>And therefore the Church knowing the power of examples upon mens nature, that they are more apt to be led by example then by precept or reaſon, and are more apt to follow a multitude in ſinne, then the light of any one Saint in vertue; hath ſet this day apart to let us underſtand, that it is better to follow one <hi>Noah</hi> in the race of righteouſneſſe, then a whole world drowned in ſin and wickedneſſe, and that for our ſoules ſalvation it is better to be like one juſt <hi>Lot,</hi> then a City full of wicked Sodomites: but it is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard matter to walk uprightly in the midſt of a crooked gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>

               <p>And now the letter of the Law ſpiritually underſtood, is turned into Goſpell: yet the owle-eyed Jewes that loved darkneſſe better than light, when <hi>Iohn</hi> ſhone in the Pulpit (like a taper on a candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticke) could ſcarſe endure him burning longer than a farthing candle, an houre was the utmoſt of their patience. This is that Star that gave an heroicall riſe of jubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in the wombe of his bleſſed Mother.</p>
               <p>At the firſt approach of this Sun, or at the firſt dawning of the day of Salvation, as the glorious Sunne entred into the bleſſed Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator, the Virgin Mother, and

And after one yeare in his miniſterial office, for teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth to fulfill the wicked deſires of a lewd ſtru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pet, prompt by her bloody mother, when hee was little more than one and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeares of age, by the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of cruel <hi>Herod,</hi> was behea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Tower of <hi>Macherus,</hi> which was a Towne of <hi>Peraea</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Jordan, twenty miles from Jeruſalem towards the Eaſt, ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated on a high Mountain; which Townes name being derived from <hi>Machera</hi> ſignifies a ſword, and <hi>Iohn</hi> dyed by a ſword.

<pb n="348" facs="tcp:58256:136"/> firſt Writer, yet it may bee ſaid, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was the firſt Preacher after the Aſcenſion of our Lord, as is evident in the firſt and ſecond of the Acts. And there hath been as glorious lights, Preachers as Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. But yet for that the Hiſtory of the Goſpell is the foundation of all writing and preaching, I will begin with Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> who wrote his Goſpel before the other three, as is evident by <hi>Revel.</hi> 6. 1. For when Chriſt (which is the Lamb there mentioned) had ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ſealed doctrine of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption in the firſt yeare of his miniſteriall office, to the ſix and thirtieth yeare after his birth, one of the foure Beaſts, which by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretours is <hi>Matthew,</hi> writes his Goſpell in the Hebrew tongue, and in the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> mighty ſtile of Gods thundring Spirit, ſet out the ſame, willing all Nations to come and ſee, <hi>viz.</hi> approach and conſider it. About which time in accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:58256:136"/> of the ſecond verſe Chriſt and his Apoſtles paſſe out and preach to all the teſtimony of the Goſpell, ſhooting the arrowes of zeale to pierce all godly hearts: which is prefigured in him that ſate on the white horſe crowned with victory, and triumphantly conquering and overcomming the world.</p>
               <p>And that S. <hi>Matthew</hi> is one of the four beaſts is evident, for both <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in his firſt chapter, and S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in his fourth makes mention, that one of the beaſts had a face like a man, which by all interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters is applyed to <hi>Matthew,</hi> becauſe hee begins his firſt face or leafe with the genealogie of Chriſt, as he is man of the ſeed of <hi>David</hi> by the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in Hebrew to the Hebrewes; ſaith, the firſt face of one of the foure beaſts was as the face of a man, meaning S. <hi>Matthew</hi> wrote
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:58256:137"/> firſt in Hebrew. But the Prophet S. <hi>John</hi> writing in Greeke to the Grecians ſaith, the firſt beaſt had the face of a Lion, meaning S. <hi>Marke</hi> who wrote firſt in Greek; &amp; S. <hi>Matthew</hi> was the third whoſe Goſpell when S. <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote his, was tranſlated out of Hebrew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Greek.</p>
               <p>Another reaſon why S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thews</hi> Goſpell is ſet firſt, is becauſe he being an Apoſtle was to give light and open the way to the reſt, as S. <hi>Iohns</hi> Goſpell is ſet laſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being an Apoſtle he might give authority and confirme the former: two which were Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and writ their Goſpell; Saint <hi>Marke</hi> by the inſtruction and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and S. <hi>Luke</hi> by the authority of S. <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> ſetting downe his owne ſtory is ſo farre from flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery that he cals himſelfe <hi>Matthew</hi> the Publican, and tels how he was called to be an Apoſtle, as he was

And as ſome report, it was in <hi>Caeſarea Philippi,</hi> where likewiſe Chriſt cured the woman afflicted with the bloody iſſue 12 yeares by the touch of the hemme of his garment. It is likewiſe related that S. <hi>Matthew</hi> having writ his Goſpel, &amp; delivered it to <hi>Iames</hi> the Lords brother then Biſhop of Jeruſalem, preached the Goſpell in Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia now called the Kingdome of <hi>Presbyter-Iohn,</hi> and was entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the <hi>Eunuch</hi> Chamberlaine to the Qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He prevailed ſo much, that <hi>Aeglippus</hi> the King of <hi>Aethiopia</hi> and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple came to baptiſme. But there reigned after him, one Hyrtacus which hated the Apoſtle, and commanded him to be runne through with a ſword. But ſome ſay he was runne through with a

               <p>What may be further writ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this bleſſed Apoſtle I leave to the learned, and conclude with the prayer for the day as the Church hath ſet it in her Liturgy, ſaying:</p>

               <p>THe next fundamentall light that appeared in the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall Sphere, was S. <hi>Marke,</hi> as appeares in the third. and fourth verſes of the ſixth of the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For when the ſecond Beaſt or Goſpell began to invite men to the peruſall thereof, then there went out another horſe which was red, and power was given to him that ſate theron to take peace from the earth, and that they ſhould kill one another, and there was given unto him a great ſword, which is thus paraphraſed, At that time proceeded tyrannous and bloody magiſtrates, ſitting in the ſeat of tyranny to whom power was given to perſecute Gods Saints on earth, and to deprive them of peace by cauſing all men to kill them, abuſing ſo the ſword
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:58256:139"/> of Juſtice, that God had given them. And this was accompliſhed at that time, when S. <hi>Steven</hi> ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red martyrdome, and <hi>Iames</hi> the brother of <hi>Iohn</hi> was beheaded for Chriſts ſake: for even then and from thenceforth the Roman Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, and Synagogue of the Jewes never ſtinted from perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and putting to death all true Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Marke</hi> is the ſecond Beaſt ſpoken by <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and the firſt by S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> that had a face like a Lion, is plaine, becauſe hee begins his firſt face or leafe at the voice (like a roaring Lion) in the wilderneſſe, <hi>prepare the way of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Marke</hi> is noted by <hi>Dorotheus</hi> to be one of the ſeventy Diſciples, and was very attentive unto the preaching of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> from whom at the earneſt perſwaſions of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny zealous Chriſtians, he wrote his Goſpell in Greek. And S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> makes mention of him in the
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:58256:139"/> laſt Chapter of his firſt Epiſtle, in theſe words, the Church of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, elected together with you ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteth you, and <hi>Marke</hi> my ſonne, and yet this Evangeliſt is moſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious in ſetting downe particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly how S. <hi>Peter</hi> thrice denyed his Lord and Maſter. He was the firſt Biſhop of Alexandria, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Goſpell in all the borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Regions from Egypt unto Pentapolis, and (as ſome affirme) in the reigne of <hi>Trajan</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, others (and they more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably) in the beginning of the reigne of <hi>Nero,</hi> had a Cable rope tyed about his neck, and by that drawne through the ſtreets of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi> that his fleſh was rent in pieces, the ſtones coloured with his blood, and in the end he bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to aſhes by thoſe furious <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,</hi> and was buried at Bucolus a place in the ſaid City. For what may be written more concerning <hi>Marke</hi> I leave to the learned: and

               <p>THe third fundamentall light that ſhewed the hiſtory of Chriſt is S. <hi>Luke.</hi> And that he was the third is plaine by the 6 Revel. 5. 6. For after the third ſealed weeke which was the 43 after the birth of Chriſt, S. <hi>Luke</hi> the third Beaſt wrote his Goſpell, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed it, that all men might come and ſee. At which time there fell
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:58256:140"/> a great univerſall famine of corne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which <hi>Agabus</hi> propheſied and foretold ſhould come to paſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Apoſtles, Diſciples and the whole Church.</p>
               <p>In this dearth the buſhell of wheat was ſold for five accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med prices, and the buſhell of barley for three. All which was prefigured by him that ſate on the black horſe with ballances in his hand, and the voice that ſpake in the midſt of the foure beaſts, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, A meaſure of wheat for a penny, and three meaſures of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley for a penny. So that this agrees with <hi>S. Luke</hi> in three reſpects.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in that he is the third Beaſt in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> &amp; the ſecond in S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> with a face like a Bull, becauſe he beginneth his face or firſt leafe at <hi>Zacharias</hi> offering incenſe (as it were a bullock) at the Altar.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Becauſe he wrote at this time.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, becauſe he makes
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:58256:141"/> relation of the famine that then hapned, 11 <hi>Acts</hi> 28, 29, 30.</p>
               <p>He was a follower of all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, in their Peregrination, but eſpecially of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who makes mention of him in two of his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, once to the <hi>Col.</hi> 4. chap. and 14. verſe, <hi>Luke</hi> the beloved Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian ſaluteth you, and in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 11. only <hi>Luke</hi> is with me.</p>
               <p>By birth he was of Antioch, but by profeſſion a Phyſitian, and he hath left us proofes of his skill in two volumes medicinable for our ſoules health: one of the Goſpell, which he reporteth to have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed according as he records it of them which from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning were beholders and miniſters of this doctrine; ſo that he ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all from the originall. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Acts of the Apoſtles, where he compiled not only the things that he heard with his ears, but alſo the things which he ſaw with his eyes. And of <hi>Paul</hi> ſome
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:58256:141"/> ſay that he accuſtomed to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Goſpell of S. <hi>Luke</hi> when he ſpake as of his owne, ſaying, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my Goſpel, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 8.</p>
               <p>And though S. <hi>Luke</hi> was ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and dependant of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> yet he alone of all others, makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the differences of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and in the ſtory of Saint <hi>Stephens</hi> death, after all his narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ended, he added a clauſe which in humane judgement might have beene left out, to wit, <hi>Saul</hi> was conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>SAint <hi>Iohn</hi> was the laſt funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall light that ſhined in the Evangelicall Hemiſphere, as is manifeſt by the forecited place of his Revelations. For when he ſet
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:58256:142"/> forth his Goſpell which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the 50 yeares and 57 after Chriſts Nativity, the pale Horſe (which by Interpreters ſignifies hereſies among the people, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therewith the death of the ſoule, and procuring hell and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall damnation) began to ariſe, who ſpake againſt the divinity of Chriſt. Wherefore S. <hi>Iohn</hi> for the ſuppreſſing and conviction of the hereſies of <hi>Cerinthus, Nicholaus, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bion, Elymas</hi> the Sorcerer, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther certaine Phariſaicall Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, wrote his Goſpell, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth at the deſcription of Chriſts divinity.</p>
               <p>But they not forſaking their hereticall opinions, God ſent his plagues againſt Judea and other parts of Aſia, the quarter of the earth where theſe hereſies reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>That S. <hi>Iohn</hi> is the fourth beaſt that had a face like an Eagle, is likewiſe evident, becauſe he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:58256:143"/> his firſt face or leaſe at the high and divine eſſence of Chriſts God-head, flying ſo high in his ſtile, that hee is compared to an Eagle.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> was the brother of <hi>Iames,</hi> who were both the ſonnes of <hi>Zebedeus,</hi> who was a Fiſher-man; and were called by Chriſt, when they were in the ſhip with their Father mending their nets. At which time (as ſome relate) Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> was but one and twenty years of age.</p>
               <p>This Apoſtle was ſo beloved of Chriſt, that he was ſuffred to leane on Chriſts boſome when he was at Supper.</p>
               <p>He, his brother and <hi>Peter</hi> were permitted to ſee Chriſts Transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration on Mount Tabor, and they three were taken from the reſt to behold his Agony in the Garden. Wherefore, the Mother of <hi>John</hi> dreaming that Chriſt ſhould bee a temporall King, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:58256:143"/> ſo much upon the love which ſhee ſaw in Chriſt towards her children, boldly asked, That they might have the greateſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, <hi>viz.</hi> one to ſit at the right hand, and the other at the left in his Kingdome. (Yet though this is noted by Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> to be the Mothers deſire, Saint <hi>Marke</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſame ſtory, Chap. 10. 35. ſaith, That it was the deſire of <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> for which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diſciples diſdained them two; to ſhew that it was their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to ſolicite their Mother to make ſuch a petition; which Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell though it touched Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> who then lived, and had the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſall thereof, never denyed it, nor took it il, but approved that, &amp; the other two Evangeliſts to be true; ſo ſincere, ſimple, and without all art of flattery or rhetorical ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication was all their writings, that they do not ſpare Chriſt himſelfe, whom they adore and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:58256:144"/> to bee their God and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, but ſhew the infirmities of his fleſh as he was a man; as his hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirſt, his being weary, and how hee wept, his paſſions of feare, anger, love, &amp;c. (therefore much leſſe would they favour the Apoſtles or themſelves) And laſt of all, Chriſt upon the Croſſe to expreſſe the great love that hee bare this Apoſtle, called the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Virgin his Mother, and him her ſonne. And from that day to her death ſhe lived with him. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after the feaſt of Pentecoſt, when hee with the reſt had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the holy Ghoſt, he with <hi>Peter</hi> was caſt into priſon for healing the cripple, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.

               <p>Foure yeares after the death of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> he was preſent at the Apoſtolicall Councell in Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem. Now <hi>Iames</hi> his brother who

               <p>After the death of <hi>Paul</hi> he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned the Churches of <hi>Aſia minor,</hi> where he wrote his Goſpell. And in the 86. year of his age being caſt into a veſſell of boyling oyle, and comming out unhurt, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Domitian</hi> the Emperour, he was baniſhed into the Ile of Pathmos, where he wrote his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation to the ſeven Churches in <hi>Aſia.</hi> It is related of him, that hee turned certain peeces of wood in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to gold, and ſtones by the ſea ſide into Margrits, to ſatisfie the deſire of two whom he perſwaded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their riches, and after they repenting that for worldly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

               <p>The Evangeliſts make more mention of him, than of any one Apoſtle beſides; as firſt they ſhew that Chriſt comming to his houſe,

And the yeare follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing went into Antioch, of which place he was the firſt Biſhop, and the Diſciples there the firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: and being at Babylon writ his firſt Epiſtle to the ſtrangers that dwelt in Pontus, Galatia, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padocia, Aſia, and Bithynia; Yet it is reported in Eccleſiaſticall hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, that <hi>Peter</hi> came from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch to withſtand <hi>Simon Magus</hi> at Rome, and there kept the Chaire 25 yeares, 12 under <hi>Claudius,</hi> and 13 under <hi>Nero.</hi>

               <p>He oppoſed <hi>Simon Magus</hi> once in reſtoring a Noble man to life, and another time when hee was going to flye into the Aire, <hi>Peter</hi> brought him down with his wings headlong to the ground; by which fall his legs and joynts were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and he thereupon dyed.</p>
               <pb n="373" facs="tcp:58256:148"/>
               <p>But there are divers of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that affirme that <hi>Peter</hi> never came to Rome at all, as may be gathered out of thoſe five Epiſtles which S. <hi>Paul</hi> writ from Rome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there a Priſoner, and in the concluſion of them names all his friends, but never makes mention of <hi>Peter</hi> in any one of them, which were written about the fifth yeare of the reigne of <hi>Nero.</hi> And when he writes to the Romans, (which was the ſecond yeare of <hi>Nero</hi>) hee never makes mention of any ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to <hi>Peter,</hi> which (if he had beene then Biſhop of that place) he would not have omitted. And if ever <hi>Peter</hi> were at Rome at all, he came thither after the laſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and a few dayes before his martyrdome: but whether it was that he was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred at Rome by the command of <hi>Nero,</hi> or at Ieruſalem by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of King <hi>Agrippa,</hi> or (as ſome ſay) at Babylon, it is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:58256:149"/> But certaine it is that hee was crowned with the wreath of martyrdome, and was crucified with his head downeward, and his feet upward, which death hee choſe, becauſe he confeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be unworthy to ſuffer in the ſame manner and forme as his Lord ſuffered. And it is reported by ſome, when his wife was led to ſuffer martyrdome, as he hung up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the croſſe (others ſay, as hee went out of doores) he greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced and encouraged her, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her by name, ſaying, Be of good comfort, and remember the Lord Ieſus.</p>
               <p>The truth of all which ſtories I leave to the conſideration of the learned, and conclude with the prayer for the day.</p>
               <p>Almighty God, which by thy Sonne Ieſus Chriſt haſt given ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny excellent gifts to thy Apoſtle S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and commandedſt him earneſtly to feed thy flock: Make

Yet this bleſſed ſtarre, for many other rare graces related of him by the Evangeliſts and other authors, may well have precedency before others.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for his earneſt deſire to draw other men to the knowledge of Chriſt: for when he heard it of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, he preſently cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his Brother <hi>Simon, Iohn</hi> 1 40.
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:58256:150"/> After when the Grecians deſired to ſee Chriſt, he with <hi>Philip</hi> made him acquainted therewith: and laſt of all he ſpent much labour &amp; time in preaching Chriſt to the barbarous Scythians, Saxons, and other Aethiopians.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for his ready wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe to follow Chriſt, and be his Diſciple: for as Ieſus paſſed by the Sea of Galilee, he ſaw him with his brother caſting a net in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſea, for they were fiſhers. And he no ſooner called them, but they left their nets and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently followed him.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, for his conſtant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance in the miniſteriall office, he deſerved this priority of place: for having a long time preached the Goſpell to divers barbarous nations, was threatned by <hi>Aegeas</hi> King of the <hi>Edeſſians,</hi> that if he would not ſurceaſe preaching Chriſt, he ſhould be crucified as his Lord was, on the croſſe. To
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:58256:150"/> whom hee gave this anſwer, and boldly ſaid, That he would not have preached the honour and glory of the croſſe, if he had fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the croſſe. And ſeeing the croſſe afarre off, with a lively and cheerefull countenance ſaid, O croſſe moſt welcome and long looked for, with a willing minde joyfully and deſirouſly I come to thee, being the Scholler of him who did hang on thee; becauſe I have beene ever thy lover, and coveted to imbrace thee: ſo being crucified gave up the ghoſt, fell a ſleepe, and was buried in <hi>Patris</hi> a City in <hi>Achaia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is all the deſcription that my ſearch in Antiquity can make of this ſtarre.

               <p>THe reaſon (as I conceive) why the luſtre of theſe two ſtarres are by the order of the Church conjoyned together on this day is, becauſe they and S. <hi>Peter</hi> only are not diſplaced in their order by all the Evangeliſts: for <hi>Peter</hi> is the firſt, <hi>Philip</hi> the fifth, and <hi>Iames</hi> the ninth in the nomination of them together. And as it is very plaine, that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Andrew, Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> the ſonnes of <hi>Zebedeus,</hi> were the foure Apoſtles that were firſt called: ſo it is likewiſe conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that <hi>Philip</hi> was the fift, for the
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:58256:151"/> twice two brethren were called in one day, as <hi>Matthew</hi> &amp; <hi>Mark</hi> note; but <hi>Philip</hi> was called the day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith expreſly, <hi>the day following Ieſus found Philip, and ſaid unto him, follow me.</hi> Therefore as the fifth Apoſtle I fix him in this ſtarry firmament.</p>
               <p>He was of Bethſaida the City of <hi>Andrew</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and was no ſooner called himſelfe, but hee went and found out <hi>Nathaneel,</hi> and ſaid unto him, <hi>we have found him of whom Moſes did write in the Law and the Prophets,</hi> Ieſus the Sonne of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of Nazareth.</p>
               <p>A rare example of a godly minde! that being converted la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, to convert others, and though he himſelfe (as ſome note) was unlearned, yet doth adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to draw and allure the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the knowledge of Chriſt: for ſome affirme that <hi>Nathaneel</hi> was a learned man: and alſo this ſhewes, that by weak meanes God
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:58256:152"/> can work great miracles, and by the fooliſhneſs of preaching work faith in the heart, which only ſaves a ſoule from eternall dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>After it is related by <hi>Iohn,</hi> that the Greeks that came up to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip at the feaſt, came to <hi>Philip</hi> and ſaid, Sir we would ſee that Ieſus; who told <hi>Andrew,</hi> and they two told Ieſus; for it ſeems <hi>Philip</hi> durſt not tell him alone, leſt Chriſt ſhould aske him ſome queſtion which he could not well anſwer, as he had tried him before by this queſtion, (when hee ſaw a great multitude about 5000 follow him into the wilderneſſe) whence ſhall we buy bread, that theſe may eat? yet not long after he of himſelfe ſhewed his own ſimplicity and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance: for Chriſt having ſpoken of the knowledge of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he interrupts him, and burſts out with this queſtion, ſhew us thy Father, and it ſufficeth. In the ſixth
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:58256:152"/> of the Acts is related, that he was choſen one of the ſeven Deacons: in the eighth of the Acts is ſhewed how hee preached the word of God, wrought wonders, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led divers diſeaſes among the people in Samaria, how he bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and converted the Aethiopian Eunuch. And in the 21 of the Acts it is declared, that he had foure Daughters Virgins and Propheteſſes, and that <hi>Paul</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode in his houſe at Ceſarea Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi for many dayes: and ſome write that he was crucified at <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropolis,</hi> where he and his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were honourably buried.</p>

               <p>He dranke neither wine, nor ſtrong drink, neither ate any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wherein there was life. He was neither ſhaven, neither anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, neither did he uſe bath: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him alone was it lawfull to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the holy places; he uſed no wollen veſture, but wore a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, and alone frequented hee the Temple, ſo that he was oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times found proſtrate on his knees praying for the ſins of the people.</p>
               <p>His knees were after the guiſe

               <p>When many of the Princes were perſwaded, there aroſe a tumult

               <p>The foreſaid Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:58256:155"/> place <hi>Iames</hi> upon the Pinacle of the Temple, and ſhouted unto him, and ſaid, Thou juſt man, at whoſe commandement we all are here, in ſo much as this people is ſeduced after <hi>Ieſus,</hi> who was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, declare unto us which is the way or doore of Jeſus crucified? And hee anſwered with a loud voice: Why aske yee mee of <hi>Ieſus</hi> the Son of Man, when as he ſitteth at the right hand of the great power in Heaven, and ſhall come in the clouds of the Aire?</p>
               <p>When as hee had perſwaded many, ſo that they glorified God at the teſtimony of <hi>Iames,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Hoſanna in the higheſt to the Sonne of David:</hi> then the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees ſaid among themſelves, wee have done very ill in cauſing ſuch a teſtimony of <hi>Ieſus</hi> to be brought forth; but let us climbe up and take him, to the end the people being ſtricken with feare, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his faith.</p>

               <p>They climbed up, and threw <hi>Iuſtus</hi> downe head-long, ſaying; let us ſtone <hi>Iames Iuſtus:</hi> and they began to throw ſtones at him, for after his fall he was not fully dead, but remembring himſelfe, fell on his knees, ſaying, I beſeech thee, Lord God, and Father, forgive them, for they wot not what they doe. And as they were a ſtoning him, one of the Prieſts, the ſon of <hi>Rechab,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Charabim</hi> (whoſe teſtimony is in <hi>Ieremy</hi> the Prophet) cryed out, ceaſe, what doe you? this Juſt man prayeth for you.

And ſince Miracles, Omnipotence, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Majeſty, Judgement, and diſcerning, are chiefly Gods: Let us above all, ſeeke to get ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent love and affection, the vertue that ſhall laſt remaine, and the property of the higheſt order, whence all the reſt are inſpired;

And ſo we ſhall be ſure to have all the reſt attend upon us. But this vertue of love, onely the God of love can grant, neither can he give it, unleſſe he give himſelf; for he is love.
